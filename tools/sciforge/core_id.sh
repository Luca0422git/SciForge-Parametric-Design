# that ends up in the compiled part of the build (FreeCAD's C++ and its packaging) rather
# than SciForge's own Python module and the docs. Two builds with the same core id have
# the same compiled program, so a release can be installed by replacing only Mod/SciForge
# (the "module update"; update_core.plan decides, brief beta-release.md R3).
#
#   tools/sciforge/core_id.sh [COMMIT]      prints the id (default: HEAD)

# Needs the full git history of the paths (not a shallow clone): in a shallow clone the id
# would be the oldest commit, which is wrong, so that case fails loudly.

# VERSION is left out on purpose: a new version number alone must not force the full installer.

# of its own commit (sciforge-patch-release.yml); counting them would refuse every patch release
# until the next full build (2026-10-28, core-patches.md #19).
