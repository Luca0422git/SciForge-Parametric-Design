"""Building blocks for SciForge's Fusion-style command dialogs.

- DistanceField: unit-aware number field (types "5", "5 mm", "0.2 in", "=width*2"),
  optionally bound to a property so expressions/parameters work like in FreeCAD.
- ArrowDragger: the arrow you drag in the 3D view to set a distance (Coin3D; its look and
  its screen size are handle_look's).
- ArrowValueBox: the small value box next to an arrow (Fusion shows the distance there
  while you drag, and you can type a new one in it).
- BoxCarrier: what any drag handle (an arrow, a turning disc, a ball on a line) needs to
  carry such a box: where its grabbable part is, and a hook its poll calls.
- ValueBoxes: a dialog's boxes, one per handle, kept while the handles are rebuilt, and
  which one a number typed over the 3D view goes to.
- TypeOverView: digits typed with the mouse over the 3D view go into that box (Fusion),
  not to FreeCAD's view keys.
- Panel: a task-dialog base that wraps the edit in one undo step: OK keeps it,
  Cancel/Esc removes it again, like Fusion.
