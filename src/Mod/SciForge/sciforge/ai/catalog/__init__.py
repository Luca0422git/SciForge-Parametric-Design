"""The catalogue of AI tools: the single source of truth for every tool an AI can call in
SciForge (docs/sciforge/dev/cadcraft-lessons.md idea 3; brief home-cloud-ai.md section 4.2).

Each tool has an id (its name), a title, a description written for an AI model, the place
of the Fusion command it copies ("SOLID > CREATE > Extrude"), a category, the JSON Schema of
its arguments (units and defaults described), example calls, the design steps (ops) it
builds, whether it only reads or changes the design (or writes files), and what it needs
before it can run (availability() says why not, in a sentence). Everything that offers tools
reads this list: the MCP server's tools/list (mcp_core), the AI bridge and the headless
backend (sciforge/ai/executor.py), the built-in chat panel's tool definitions (chat_core),
the Claude extension's manifest (installers) and the generated documentation.

The tools are defined in the modules below, grouped like Fusion's ribbon: core_tools (the
first sixteen, whose names and argument shapes never change), sketch_tools, create_tools,
modify_tools, more_tools (surface, construct, assemble, inspect), history_tools
(timeline, parameters, files, drawings, view, help), verify_tools (the tools an agent checks
its own work with: inspect_design, query_geometry, check_design, render, diff_design) and
docs_tools (the documentation: docs_search, docs_read, examples_search). There is no tool
that runs arbitrary code. Pure Python: no FreeCAD, no Qt (the MCP server an AI app starts
imports it).
