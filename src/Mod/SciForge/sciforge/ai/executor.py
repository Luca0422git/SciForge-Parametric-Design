"""Runs AI tool calls in SciForge (needs FreeCAD; Qt only through the host).

One place does the work for every way an AI reaches SciForge: the AI bridge inside the
running app (sciforge/ai/bridge.py), the built-in chat panel (through the bridge) and the
headless backend under FreeCAD's command-line mode (sciforge/ai/headless.py: the MCP server's
--headless mode and sciforge-cli). What differs between them is the host: it answers
questions to the person (overwrite a file?), saves the SciForge way (version history in the
app, a plain save headless), knows the active body (the 3D view's, or remembered here) and
takes screenshots (only with a window).

A call is checked against the catalogue (sciforge/ai/catalog: its schema, its rules, then
whether it can run now: availability), then either built as design steps with the ops layer
(sciforge/ai/ops: the same code as the golden models and the dialogs) or done by an action
(sciforge/ai/actions). Every call that changes the design is one Undo step ("AI: Extrude 10
mm"); a failure takes the half-made change back. Answers are bridge_core results: plain
sentences, JSON for the read-only tools, a PNG for screenshots. Never raises.
