"""The AI tools that are not design steps (sciforge/ai/catalog says which): reading the
design, the timeline, parameters, design files, drawings, the view, sketch editing,
assembly, the checking tools (verify_actions) and the documentation tools (docs_actions).
Each action is a function (ctx, args) -> bridge_core result, registered with
@action("tool name"); sciforge/ai/executor.py calls it after the arguments were checked and
the tool is available. Actions call the same SciForge code as the commands and dialogs
(timeline_ops, parameters, drawing, joints...), never raw FreeCAD calls that would skip
SciForge's behaviour. Needs FreeCAD."""
