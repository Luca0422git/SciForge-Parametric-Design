"""Selection like Fusion on the 3D view: box selection (window / crossing, freeform, paint),
Select Other on a long press, selection filters and priorities, Select Through, the
Fusion modifier keys. The rules and maths are in selection_core.py (no Qt, unit tested).

How it is built (SciForge's own code; Fusion's behaviour, see parity/selection.md):

* A Qt event filter on each 3D view's drawing area sees the left button before FreeCAD
  (like orbit_ui.py for the middle button). The press goes on to FreeCAD and to SciForge's
  handles untouched. When the mouse then moves more than a few pixels with the button
  down, SciForge draws its own box (a see-through widget over the view) and swallows the
  moves and the release: FreeCAD, which selects on the release, never selects anything
  for a drag. The box's contents are worked out from the model's geometry projected to
  the screen and selected through Gui.Selection, so every dialog's selection observer
  gets them as picks (and every dialog's selection gate still applies).
* A press that stays put for about a second opens the Select Other list (FreeCAD's own
  long-press "Clarify Selection" menu is turned off while SciForge is on): everything
  under the pointer, front to back; hovering a row shows it on the model.
* The selection filters are a FreeCAD selection gate, so a filtered kind does not even
  light up under the mouse. A dialog that installs its own gate gets it combined with the
  filters (Gui.Selection.addSelectionGate / removeSelectionGate are wrapped while SciForge
  is on), as Fusion's filters also apply inside commands.
* Shift adds (FreeCAD's own Shift does nothing: a Shift click is handed on as a Ctrl
  click, except on something already selected, which Fusion keeps). Ctrl toggles, as in
  FreeCAD. With the Body priority, a click on a face selects the whole body.
* Esc with no command open clears the selection (Fusion); keys 1 / 2 / 3 choose the mode.
