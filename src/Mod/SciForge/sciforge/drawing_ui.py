"""Fusion's DRAWING workspace in SciForge: the commands, their dialogs and the mouse on
the sheet (the drawing logic is in drawing.py, the maths in drawing_core.py).

A drawing opens in its own tab (TechDraw's page view). While that tab is the active one
the ribbon shows only the contextual DRAWING tab, like Fusion's Drawing workspace, and
the design's timeline and navigation bar step aside. Clicks on the sheet go to the
command that is open (PageInput): placing a view, drawing a section line, picking edges
for a dimension... With no command open, a double-click edits a view or the title block,
D starts a dimension and Del deletes what is selected.
