"""Fusion's sketch Text, without GUI code: the Text dialog (text_ui.py), Extrude, Emboss
and the golden-model builder all use this module.

A text belongs to a sketch, like Fusion's (one entity of the sketch, edited with a
double-click, exploded into curves on request). In FreeCAD it is a small object of its
own next to the sketch, in the same body:

  SketchText   a Part::Part2DObjectPython (SciForgeType / SciForgeRole "SketchText") that
               keeps what the Text dialog shows (text, height, font, bold / italic /
               underline, alignment, character spacing, flips, type, path placement) and
               whose shape is the letters as flat faces in the sketch's plane. Extrude and
               Emboss take it as one profile (Fusion: a click on a text picks the whole
               text); PartDesign's Pad uses its faces directly. It is never a timeline step
               or a browser row of its own: it is part of its sketch.
  the frame    Type Text: four construction lines in the sketch, a rectangle that can be
               dimensioned and constrained like any sketch geometry (Fusion's text frame).
               The letters are set inside it (alignment), turned with it (Angle) and move
               with it. The text finds its lines by their geometry ids (FrameIds), which
               FreeCAD keeps across edits, undo and saving.
  the path     Type Text On Path: a curve of the sketch (PathId) the letters follow.

The letters' outlines come from FreeCAD's FreeType reader (Part.makeWireString) for the
font file of the chosen family (fonts.py finds it); each character is outlined once per
font and placed with text_core's layout. A family that is not installed (a design opened
on another computer) falls back to the default family and says so; the saved shape stays
as it was until the text is computed again.
