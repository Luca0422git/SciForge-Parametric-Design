"""Components, the way Fusion has them, on FreeCAD's document (no Qt: the golden-model
builder, headless tests and the dialogs all use this).

The model (a contract other features rely on, see docs/sciforge/parity/components.md):

- A component is an ``App::Part`` container. Its name in the browser is its ``Label``.
  Bodies (``PartDesign::Body``) live inside it (``part.Group``), and sketches, features and
  construction geometry live inside their body as FreeCAD's PartDesign needs. A nested
  component is an ``App::Part`` inside an ``App::Part``.
- The root component is the document itself: a design with no component has no container
  at all, so every single-body workflow and file from before components keeps working.
- One component is **active** and gets every new sketch, body and feature. FreeCAD's own
  active-object slot "part" (``Gui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView.setActiveObject("part", obj)``)
  holds it; the active body (slot "pdbody") always lies inside it. ``active_component()``
  reads it: the active body's container when a body is active, else the "part" slot, else
  the root (None). A file opens with the root active (Fusion does the same).
- ``commands.find_body()`` / ``commands.ensure_body()`` give a body *inside* the active
  component (creating one there when it has none), so every command that puts work into
  "the body" puts it into the active component.

    list_components(doc)          every component, in the order they were made
    container_of(obj)             the component an object (body, sketch, component) is in
    component_of(obj)             the same, but a component is its own component
    is_inside(obj, component)     obj lies in component (or in one inside it); root: True
    bodies_in(doc, component)     the bodies directly in a component (None: the root)
    components_in(doc, component) the components directly in a component (None: the root)
    new_component(doc, label, parent)   an empty component (no undo step of its own)
    new_body_in(doc, container)         an empty body in a component ("Body1" per component)
    from_bodies(doc, bodies)            Create Components from Bodies: one per body
    place(obj, component)               move a body / component into another (None: root)
    remove(doc, component)              delete a component with everything inside it (an
