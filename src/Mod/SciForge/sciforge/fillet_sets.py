"""SciForge's own Fillet / Chamfer step, for what FreeCAD's PartDesign::Fillet / Chamfer cannot
hold (one constant size for every edge): several selection sets with their own size (Fusion's
"+" rows), Chord Length and Variable radius, Tangent Chain off, Rule Fillet, Full Round
Fillet, and chamfer sets. No Qt: the dialog (fillet_ui.py) and the golden-model builder use it.

A plain fillet / chamfer (one row, one constant size, Tangent Chain on) stays FreeCAD's
feature (blend.py), so Press Pull and the parameters table keep editing it; the dialog
swaps the step for this one the moment an option needs it.

The step: a PartDesign::FeaturePython with SciForgeType "FilletSets" / "ChamferSets":
  Picks          the picked edges / faces of every row, in row order (one link, so FreeCAD
                 and picks.py keep them through edits). Rule Fillet: the faces of the first
                 box; Full Round: side face, centre face, side face of each row
  Picks2         Rule Fillet, Between Faces/Features: the faces of the second box
  RuleFeatures, RuleFeatures2   Rule Fillet: whole steps picked in the two boxes
  SciForgeBlend  the settings (fillet_core: rows, types, rule, corner...), JSON
  Size<i>        row i's radius / chord length / distance (a parameter can drive it)
  SizeB<i>, Angle<i>   chamfer row i's second distance / angle
  Refine         merge faces that end up in one plane

How it is built (OpenCASCADE through FreeCAD's Python API):
  * one BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet run with a radius per edge: FreeCAD's Python makeFillet
    takes one radius for all edges, so a radius per edge goes through a Part::Fillet in a
    throw-away hidden document (kernel()); likewise Part::Chamfer for chamfer rows;
  * Chord Length: the radius that gives that chord at each end of each edge;
  * Variable: the edge (with its tangent chain) is cut at the radius points by a vertex
    (generalFuse), each piece gets its two end radii, and OpenCASCADE runs one smooth
    law through them;
  * Tangent Chain off: OpenCASCADE always rounds the whole tangent chain. The material it
    removes along the chain edges that were not picked is put back (cut at the corner where
    the picked edge meets them);
  * Full Round: the slab under the centre face, minus a cylinder of half the width between
    the side faces, is cut away;
  * Rule Fillet: the edges are found again from the faces / steps at every compute, so an
    edit that adds edges to them gets those rounded too (Fusion's "rule").
