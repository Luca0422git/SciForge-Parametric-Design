"""Fusion's sketch environment on top of FreeCAD's Sketcher.

While SciForge is on, every sketch that is opened (FreeCAD "edit mode") behaves like
a Fusion sketch:

- Esc stops the drawing tool; a second Esc clears the selection. Esc never closes
  the sketch (only Finish Sketch does).
- No pop-ups: a new dimension gets a small box next to it where you type the value
  (Enter keeps it, Esc keeps the measured value). Double-clicking a dimension opens
  the same box instead of FreeCAD's "Insert length" window.
- Closed regions (profiles) are shaded light blue while you draw, also where curves
  cross (sketch_regions.py). A click inside one (not on a curve) picks it for E / Q,
  Ctrl or Shift + click adds more (sketch_areas.py). After Finish Sketch the areas stay
  clickable: FreeCAD's sketch areas (MakeInternals) are on for every sketch; with no
  command running they come before the face they are drawn on, and commands that cannot
  use them click through them (sketch_area_pick.py).
- The SKETCH PALETTE sits at the top of the sketch panel (sketch_palette.py): Look At,
  grid, snap, slice, show profiles/points/dimensions/constraints/projected geometry.
- Sketch curves use Fusion's colours on the dark background (blue = not fully
  constrained, white = fully constrained, orange = construction, purple = projected).
- The circumscribed polygon previews and builds with the mouse on the middle of an
  edge (FreeCAD's polygon tool only knows corners).

Everything here is undone by disable(): parameters get their old values back.

Rules followed (docs/sciforge/dev/feature-guide.md): FreeCAD's Python event and
observer hooks only schedule work with QTimer.singleShot; Coin nodes are only read and
changed from Qt timers (never from pivy callbacks).
