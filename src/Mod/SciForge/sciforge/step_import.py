"""STEP and IGES files with their structure, without Qt (File > Open, Insert STEP): every
product of the file becomes a component, nested as in the file, named after it, with its
solids as bodies and its colours; a part used twice comes in once and the other occurrences
are linked copies of it (instances.py). The rules are in exchange_core.py, the spec in
docs/sciforge/parity/insert-export.md ("Part 2").

How the file is read: FreeCAD's own reader (Import.insert with link groups, the reader of
FreeCAD 1.x that keeps assemblies) runs in a hidden throw-away document; every node of what
it builds (App::LinkGroup = an assembly, Part::Feature = a part, App::Link = a repeated
occurrence) is turned into a plain node with its solids in the file's coordinates; then the
throw-away document is closed and SciForge's components and bodies are made from the nodes.
