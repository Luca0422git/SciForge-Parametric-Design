"""Decal (INSERT > Decal), the document side (no Qt): a picture laid on a face of a body, flat
or curved, that follows the body. decal_ui.py is the dialog and the drawing; the maths without
FreeCAD is decal_core.py. Spec and sources: docs/sciforge/parity/misc.md.

A decal is an App::FeaturePython (SciForgeType "Decal", a step in the timeline after the step
whose face it is on; in the body's component, in the browser's Decals folder) holding:
  Body / FaceName      the body and the face (followed when the body changes: see follow())
  Anchor               the decal's frame on the face (origin, the face's outward normal as Z),
                       in the coordinates of the body's shape (its component's)
  BodyPlace            the body's own placement when the decal was computed: a body moved by
                       its placement since (a joint) is drawn moved (decal_ui), no recompute
  FaceRecord           the face as it was at the last good compute (where its surface's own
                       frame stood under the decal, its corners, area): how the face moved
                       since is found from it, and the decal moves the same way
  Surface              Plane, Cylinder (the picture wraps round the axis) or Other (laid
                       straight onto the frame's plane)
  ImageFile            the picture, kept inside the design file
  Opacity, ChainFaces, XDistance, YDistance, ZAngle, ScaleX, ScaleY, BaseWidth,
  BaseHeight, FlipHorizontal, FlipVertical
  MeshPoints / MeshUV / MeshNormals / MeshTriangles: the face's triangles cut to the
                       picture (what is drawn), rebuilt by every recompute.
Saved documents store "sciforge.decal.DecalFeature": keep the name.
