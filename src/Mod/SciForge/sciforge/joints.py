"""Fusion's joints on FreeCAD 1.1.4's Assembly solver: the document side (no Qt; the dialogs
are in joints_ui.py, the maths in joints_core.py). Spec: docs/sciforge/parity/joints.md.

How it fits FreeCAD (the component contract of the spec):

- The parts a joint moves are the topmost objects of the design: a PartDesign::Body at the
  document root, an App::Part component at the root (its bodies move with it), or a
  Part::Feature solid at the root. Motion is a change of that object's Placement.
- One hidden Assembly::AssemblyObject ("SciForgeAssembly") holds the joints in its Joints
  group; it owns no body or component (the solver reads each part's Placement through the
  joint's references). It is made on the first joint, ground or rigid group.
- A joint is an App::FeaturePython with the proxy JointProxy below, a subclass of FreeCAD's
  own JointObject.Joint, so the C++ solver treats it as one of its own; SciForge keeps its
  Fusion-side data (type, the two snaps, offsets, axes, limits' rest) in extra properties and
  computes the two joint coordinate systems (Placement1/2) itself, Fusion's way.
- Planar rides on FreeCAD's Distance joint between two flat faces (distance 0); Pin-Slot adds
  a hidden helper joint (Distance 0 between a point and a plane) that keeps the pin on the
  slot's line. Rigid groups are hidden Fixed helper joints between the members.
