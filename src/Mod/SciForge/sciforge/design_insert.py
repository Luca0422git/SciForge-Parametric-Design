"""Insert into Current Design (Fusion's Insert > Insert into Current Design, the Data
Panel's right-click): another saved design comes in as one component named after it,
linked to its file, and Break Link makes it independent. No Qt. Spec and sources:
docs/sciforge/parity/insert-export.md ("Part 2") and parity/versions.md.

Fusion (help "Insert designs"): "The design is inserted as an external component ... An
Insert feature displays in the Timeline. The external component instance is associatively
linked to the source design"; then the Initial Position dialog places it. Autodesk blog:
right-click > Break Link: "Your component now becomes a stand-alone part, and you're free
to edit its features within your current file".

How it is built on FreeCAD: the component is an App::Part (SciForgeType Component, the
file's name in `SciForgeLinkedFile`, relative to this design) holding, for every body of
the other design, a copy body whose first step is a `LinkedCopy` (Part::FeaturePython in
the component, hidden from the timeline) that copies the other design's body through an
App::PropertyXLink: FreeCAD stores the link by the file's path relative to this design and
opens the other design (hidden) with it, so a project folder moved as a whole keeps
working. Bodies of the other design's components come in flat (as in a copy of a
component). Break Link copies the other design's bodies with every feature
(``Document.copyObject`` across documents) into the component in place of the copies.

insert_copy (a design dragged from the Data Panel, Luca 2026-10-23: "make it a copy of the
file") does Insert and Break Link in one go, and keeps the other design's components: its
top-level components and bodies are copied with everything in them into one new component.
