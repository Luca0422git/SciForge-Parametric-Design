"""Linked instances of a component and independent copies (Fusion's Copy / Paste / Paste New,
the copies of Move's Create Copy and of a pattern of components). No Qt.

Fusion: "Copy, then Paste: the new component is linked to the original component as an
identical duplicate" (editing one changes all; the browser names them "Bracket:1",
"Bracket:2"); Paste New makes an independent component with its own features.

How an instance is built on FreeCAD (so every other SciForge tool sees an ordinary component:
the browser, joints, export, measure, drawings, interference):

- An instance is an ``App::Part`` (a component) with ``SciForgeInstanceOf`` linking the
  component it repeats (its *source*), labelled "<source>:<n>". It carries its own
  Placement: it is moved like any component.
- For every body of the source (nested components' bodies too) it holds a *copy body*
  whose first step is an ``InstanceCopy`` feature (inside the instance part, hidden from
  the timeline) that copies the source body's solid. So a change to the source (a new
  fillet, a changed extrude, a moved source body) shows in every instance at the next
  recompute, and the instance cannot be edited on its own (Fusion edits the component,
  i.e. all its occurrences: activating an instance activates its source).
- A pattern of components (component_pattern.py) makes instances whose copies are placed
  by the pattern (``Pattern`` + ``Index`` on the copy feature): they follow the pattern
  step's movements instead of their own Placement.
- ``sync(doc)`` adds a copy body when the source gets a new body and removes copies whose
  source body is gone; the labels follow the source's name. It runs after recomputes (a
  watch installed by the workbench) and after every instance operation.

Paste New copies the source component with every object in it (``doc.copyObject``): an
independent component named "<source> (1)".
