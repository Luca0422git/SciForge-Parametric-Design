"""GUI pieces the body tools share (Combine, Split Body, Move/Copy, Delete, Appearance,
Physical Material):

- StepViewProvider: the view provider of their timeline steps (icon, double-click edits).
  Saved in files as "sciforge.bodies_gui.StepViewProvider": keep the name.
- Watch: one document observer that, after every recompute, undo/redo and delete, shows
  bodies a Combine no longer uses up (and hides the ones it does), re-applies appearances,
  and removes the extra bodies of a deleted Split Body or copy. Nothing is done inside
  FreeCAD's own callbacks: the work runs a moment later from a Qt timer.
- BodyPick: what a click in the 3D view (or the browser) means for a body tool.
