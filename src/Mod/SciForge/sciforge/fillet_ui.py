"""Fillet (F) and Chamfer with Fusion's dialogs.

Picking works like inside a Fusion command:
  * click edges in the 3D view to add them, click a picked one again to drop it
    (no Ctrl needed; clicking empty space does not lose the picks);
  * click a face to round every sharp edge around it;
  * click a feature in the timeline to round the edges that feature made;
  * edges tangent to a picked edge are picked with it (Tangent Chain; it can be turned off);
  * press F with edges already selected and the fillet starts at once.
While picking, the part before the fillet is shown see-through with the picks
highlighted, and the result is previewed solid on top. A blue arrow on the first
edge drags the radius (chamfer: the distance; two arrows for two distances).
A size dragged or typed past what fits stops at the largest size that works (Luca,
2026-10-21; Fusion refuses it instead), and the dialog says so: "Largest that fits here: 3.47
mm" (value_limits.py). A size from a formula is not rewritten: it is reported in the dialog,
with that limit, and OK waits for a fix. Nothing is printed to the Report view.
While an arrow is dragged the round (or bevel) follows the mouse as a live picture
(fillet_live.py, a few milliseconds per move) and the exact solid is built once the mouse
rests or is let go, as Draft's does (2026-10-23).

Fusion's selection box has rows ("+" adds one): each row is a selection set with its own
size and type, one step in the timeline, one undo step. The Fillet dialog also has
Fusion's Type (Fillet / Rule Fillet / Full Round Fillet), Radius Type (Constant / Chord
Length / Variable with radius points) and Tangent Chain on/off; the Chamfer dialog has
chamfer sets. A plain fillet / chamfer (one row, one constant size, Tangent Chain on) is
FreeCAD's PartDesign::Fillet / Chamfer (refined), so Press Pull's fillet editing
(presspull_core.owning_fillet) keeps working on it; anything more is SciForge's own step
(fillet_sets.py): the dialog turns FreeCAD's step into SciForge's the moment it is needed.
