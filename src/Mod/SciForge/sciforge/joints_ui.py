"""Fusion's ASSEMBLE joints: the dialogs and commands (the document side is joints.py, the
maths joints_core.py, the behaviour spec docs/sciforge/parity/joints.md).

Joint (J): two clicks. Hover a component and its snap points light up (a face's centre, its
corners, its edges' midpoints and round edges' centres; an edge's ends and middle; a corner),
the nearest one carrying a small triad that shows where the joint origin would be and how it
points. The first click picks component 1 (it moves), the second component 2: component 1
flies onto component 2 (faces mate) and the motion is previewed. The Position tab holds the
Mode, Offset X / Y / Z, Angle and Flip; the Motion tab the Type (Rigid, Revolute, Slider,
Cylindrical, Pin-Slot, Planar, Ball), its axes, Animate and the limits. OK keeps it (one undo
step), Cancel / Esc puts everything back.

Also here: As-Built Joint, Joint Origin, Rigid Group, Drive Joints, Ground / Unground
(browser right-click), Capture Position / Revert, the view providers of the joint objects
and a document watch that removes a deleted component's joints.
