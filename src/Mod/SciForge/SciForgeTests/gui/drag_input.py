"""Mouse input the way a real mouse delivers it, and a slow part, for the scenario about
drags whose release gets lost (scenarios/drag_release_lost.py, sciforge/drag_guard.py).

Most scenarios send QTest events straight to the 3D view widget. That skips part of Qt's
own routing, and a lost release is all about that routing. Here input goes to the main
window's QWindow (QTest's QWindow overloads), the path a hardware mouse takes:
  - Qt keeps track of which buttons are down (QApplication.mouseButtons()),
  - Qt's implicit grab sends the release to the widget that took the press,
  - every application event filter sees the event first (FreeCAD's progress bar, which
    swallows mouse releases while the document recomputes).

The slow part (add_slow_part) is an App::FeaturePython that takes about 0.7 s to
recompute while SLOW["on"] is set, like a heavy part does: every preview recompute then
shows FreeCAD's progress bar. release_during_recompute() lets the mouse button come up
from inside that recompute, the moment a person's release gets eaten.

Kept outside scenarios/ because every file there is run as a scenario.
