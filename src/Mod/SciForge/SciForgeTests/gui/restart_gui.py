"""FreeCAD opened in SciForge a second time (Luca, 2026-10-17: the second start showed only
the browser and an empty view). Run twice with one profile by run_tests.sh:

    SCIFORGE_SMOKE_OUT=/dir SCIFORGE_RESTART_PHASE=1 FreeCAD restart_gui.py
    SCIFORGE_SMOKE_OUT=/dir SCIFORGE_RESTART_PHASE=2 FreeCAD restart_gui.py

Each start checks that SciForge's ribbon, document tabs bar and timeline are shown, that
it opened on its Home tab with the browser closed and its AI column in the look's colour, then closes the window as a person does (FreeCAD saves its window
layout then), and writes restart-<phase>.json. The first start saves a design and closes
it; the second start's Home lists it first in Recent.
