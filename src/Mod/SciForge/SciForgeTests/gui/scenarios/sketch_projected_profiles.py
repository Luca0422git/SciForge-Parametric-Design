"""Shapes drawn against projected edges are profiles of their own (Luca: "When lines are
connected to a projection on a face, any shape that is sketched will not be selectable to
extrude; only the whole face"), with real mouse moves and clicks.

A block 40 x 30 x 10. Create Sketch on its top face: the face's edges are projected (Auto
project, sciforge/sketch_auto_project.py).
1. R: a rectangle from 3 px off the projected corner (0, 0) to (12, 10): its corner lands
   exactly on the projected corner (sketch_infer snapping), not a hair beside it.
2. L: two lines from the projected bottom edge at (26, 0) up to (26, 12) and right onto
   the projected right edge at (40, 12): with the projected edges they close an area.
3. In the open sketch: three areas, 120 (the rectangle), 168 (the one against the corner)
   and 912 (the rest of the face).
4. Finish Sketch, E: Extrude takes the rectangle by itself (the one area the drawn curves
   close on their own, as without the projected edges); a click inside the U adds it; 5
   mm, OK: the block grows by (120 + 168) x 5 = 1440, not by the whole face.
5. Undo / Redo.
