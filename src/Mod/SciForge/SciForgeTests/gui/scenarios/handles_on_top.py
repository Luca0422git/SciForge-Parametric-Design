"""Drag arrows show in front of the part and can be grabbed through it (Luca, 2026-10-13:
"arrows for dragging currently get occluded by bodies").

Fusion's manipulators are drawn over the model and never hidden by it. Block 40 x 30 x 10,
click the top face, Q: the Press Pull arrow stands on the top face pointing up. The camera
is put below the block, looking up at a slant: the arrow is now behind the block.

A  The pixel at the arrow's head shows the arrow's blue, not the block.
B  A press on that pixel and a drag along the arrow move the face (the arrow was grabbed
   through the block; the block's bottom face was not picked instead).
C  Esc closes the dialog and the arrow goes.
