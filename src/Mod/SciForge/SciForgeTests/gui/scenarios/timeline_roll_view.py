"""Rolling the timeline marker back must change what the 3D view shows: the later
features disappear, and a click on the part lands on the step at the marker. (Before,
the view kept showing the last step, so a click could hit a rolled-back feature and a
sketch attached there failed; found by the extrude QA, flaky in the full suite.)"""
