"""Sketching on faces after the first extrude was edited and a later extrude joined the part
(Luca, 2026-10-16: "sketching on an edited object will revert it to a previous state, making
it impossible to sketch on edited faces"). Only real input; fixsketch_steps has the shared
steps and why.

Block 40 x 30 x 10 (Create Sketch, XY, rectangle, Finish, E, 10, OK).
  A  Double-click Extrude 1 in the timeline, 15, OK: 40 x 30 x 15. Create Sketch on the top,
     a circle r 5, E, 5, OK: a boss.
  B  Create Sketch on XY, a rectangle x 40..60, Finish, E, 15, OK: it joins the part, the top
     is one face 60 long. Create Sketch on the top where the join made it (x 55): the
     sketch hangs on the first extrude's top (the same face), the part stays drawn 60 long
     with A's boss (before: it went back to the first extrude, 40 long, without the boss,
     and the clicked spot was off the part). A circle r 2 there, E, 5, OK.
  C  Create Sketch on the front face where the join made it (x 55): drawn as it is; a
     circle r 2, E, 3, OK: a boss out of the front.
  D  Ctrl+Z: C's boss goes, the part is drawn with every edit; Ctrl+Y: back.
  E  Double-click B's sketch in the timeline: the design is drawn as it is at the sketch:
     with the join, without B's boss and what came after; Finish Sketch.

Hand-derived: 40*30*15 = 18000; the join adds 20*30*15 = 9000; a boss r x d adds pi r^2 d
(r as drawn).
