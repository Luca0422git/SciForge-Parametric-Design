"""When a face of the ViewCube is seen straight on, four small triangles turn the view 90
degrees to the neighbouring face and two curved arrows turn the picture 90 degrees about
the line of sight (Inventor's cube has these; Fusion's exact set is unconfirmed).

A block 40 x 30 x 10, isometric view: no arrows. Click FRONT: the six arrows appear.
Up triangle: TOP (+Y up). Down: FRONT. Right: RIGHT. Left: FRONT. Left: LEFT. Right: FRONT.
Clockwise arrow: still looking at FRONT, the model's top now points right (up on screen
is -X). Counter-clockwise: FRONT upright again; once more: +X up; clockwise: FRONT.
With FreeCAD's animation on, two quick clicks on the right triangle add up: BACK; two
clicks 150 ms apart (the view still turning) add up too: FRONT. The arrow under the mouse
lights up blue."""
