"""Recovery copies of unchanged designs are not written again (versions_ui.Recovery,
SciForge speed with big designs; review finding F2, 2026-10-22).

Writing a recovery copy of a big design freezes the window for seconds, so a design that did
not change since its last copy is skipped. Writing one design's copy moved the change counter
(doc_epoch) that the other designs' copies compare with, so with two changed designs open
every tick rewrote both. The recovery timer is stopped and the ticks are made by hand:
1. one changed design: the first tick writes it, the second writes nothing;
2. a second changed design: the next tick writes it, the two ticks after it write nothing;
3. a real change to the first design: the next tick writes its copy again (at least it).
