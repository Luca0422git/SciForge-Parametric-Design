"""A finished sketch on a face is drawn cleanly over the face (Luca: "Faces that are
sketched on have z-fighting"), checked on screen pixels.

A block 40 x 30 x 10; Create Sketch on its top face (its edges are projected), a circle,
Finish Sketch. The sketch's areas (FreeCAD's SoSketchFaces) lie exactly on the top face:
they used to fight it for the same pixels (stripes and specks of the face's colour through
the area's) whenever SciForge's front shift was 0 (inside a command) or out of date (after
a zoom); now they are drawn with a polygon offset in front of faces
(sciforge/sketch_area_pick.py), and Extrude's shaded profiles too (profile_pick.py).

At each stage the colours of small patches inside the disc and inside the face around it
must each be one colour (within a few levels): no command; after a wheel zoom; seen at a
slant; inside Fillet (F, a command that cannot use sketch areas); inside Extrude (E, its own
profile shading). (The sandbox's software renderer resolves equal depths the same way every
time, so this guards the drawing; the stripes themselves showed on Luca's graphics card.)
