"""The origin squares of Create Sketch are small like Fusion's (Luca, 2026-10-18, with a
picture of Fusion's: "make it small like that, but keep the color"), with real clicks.

A  A new design, Create Sketch: the view shows the origin with room round it (not zoomed
   onto the squares); each square is about origin_look.SCREEN_SIDE pixels on the screen and
   lies in the + quarter of its plane, a little off the axes; colours XY blue, XZ green, YZ
   red as before.
B  Zoom in: the squares keep their size on the screen.
C  Esc. A box 60 x 40 x 20 centred on the origin; Create Sketch: the squares stay at the
   origin like Fusion's (Luca 2026-10-19: squares that moved round the part confused), also
   after the view turns; XZ picked in the browser (Origin > XZ) makes a sketch on XZ.
