"""Closing a drawing never takes the program down (Luca, 2026-10-16: "when I made a drawing
from a pre-existing body and close the drawing, the entire FreeCAD closes ... when i start
it up again, it says it didn't shut down correctly").

A crash ends the run before the result file is written, so every path below is a check.

A  A block (pre-existing body). File > New Drawing > OK: the drawing opens in its tab and
   the Base View dialog starts by itself. The drawing tab's close button (x) clicked while
   the Base View dialog is still open: the tab closes, the dialog with it, the design's tab
   is current again (SOLID shown), the Report view is clean.
B  The drawing opened again (double-click in the browser's Drawings folder); a base view
   placed and OK'd; the tab's x again: closed, back to the design.
C  Opened again; Window > Close (Ctrl+F4, FreeCAD's close of the current tab).
D  Opened again; the whole design closed (File > Close, nothing saved) while the drawing's
   tab is current; FreeCAD asks at once whether Redo can run, as its command update does
   every 150 ms (the closed tab answered from the closed design: SIGSEGV, drawing2_breakout
   under load, 2026-10-30); a new design afterwards works (a box extruded).
