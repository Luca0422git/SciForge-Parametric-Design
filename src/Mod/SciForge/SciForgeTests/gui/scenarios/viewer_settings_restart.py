"""SciForge puts FreeCAD's own viewer settings back when it is switched off, also after a
session that ended with SciForge on (FreeCAD saves its preferences when it quits, with
SciForge's values in them).

Found on GitHub: each test part shares one FreeCAD profile, so an earlier scenario had quit
with SciForge on; viewcube_menu then switched to Part Design and FreeCAD's own cube did not
come back, because SciForge had taken its own values for the user's. A user who quits with
SciForge on and later uses another workbench would have met the same.

A new session is imitated by reloading SciForge's theme module (its memory is gone, the
preferences stay), as when FreeCAD starts again:
  1. Before SciForge: FreeCAD's cube is shown. SciForge on: it is hidden, the orbit is the
     turntable.
  2. "Restart" with SciForge on, then Part Design: FreeCAD's cube is back and every setting
     SciForge changes is as it was before SciForge.
  3. SciForge on again; "restart" and go to Part Design without SciForge ever being on in
     that session: the same.
