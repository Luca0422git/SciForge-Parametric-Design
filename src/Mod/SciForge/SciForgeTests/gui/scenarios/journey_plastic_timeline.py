"""PLASTIC journey, part 3 (real clicks and keys; steps in journey_plastic_steps.py): the
enclosure of part 1 built again, then its timeline used across both components with the root
active: the history marker dragged before the Boss (both halves back to their shells, by
hand) and to the end (all back); the Lip suppressed from its right-click menu (the lip and
the groove in the Lid both gone) and unsuppressed; the Snap Fit deleted (its groove step goes
with it, the back wall whole again: + 21.824) and Ctrl+Z (all back)."""
