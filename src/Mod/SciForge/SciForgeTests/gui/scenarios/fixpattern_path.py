"""Luca's report (2026-10-16): a pattern of bodies broke when its original was moved,
edited or deleted. Pattern on Path (CREATE menu), Pattern Type Bodies, along a sketch line
on XY from (0, -10) to (200, -10), Quantity 3, Distance 100: Body2 at x 50..90, Body3 at
x 100..140.

The steps (only real input) and the hand-derived numbers are in fixpattern_steps.py: the
original moved 20 up after the pattern, a hole cut in it after the pattern, its Extrude 1
(before the pattern) edited from the timeline, the original deleted, undo / redo of each,
save and reopen.
