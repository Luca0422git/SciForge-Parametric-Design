"""Unfold in a design with two sheet metal bodies (QA), real input only: the L bracket and a
40 x 30 plate made with the Flange as a new body beside it (setup). SHEET METAL > Unfold, a
click on the bracket's top face, Unfold All Bends ticked: the bracket lies flat (preview).
Then a click on the plate's top face: the dialog moves to the plate, and the bracket is
folded again with no Unfold step left in it (before QA the bracket kept the preview step,
whose stationary face was then set to the plate's face). The plate has no bend: OK is
refused ("no bend to unfold") instead of adding an Unfold that does nothing. Esc: no Unfold
anywhere, both bodies as they were."""
