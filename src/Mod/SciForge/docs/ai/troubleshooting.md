# Troubleshooting: failures and how to recover

What goes wrong most often when an AI builds in SciForge, what SciForge answers, and what to
do. A call that fails changes nothing (there is nothing to undo; only what `redo` could
bring back is gone, as after any change, and the answer says so); a call that worked but did
the wrong thing is taken back with `undo`. Every block below is run by SciForge's tests, so
the messages are the real ones.

The part most blocks start from: a 60 x 40 x 10 plate.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "Troubles"}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"rect": [0, 0, 60, 40]}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 10},
   "expect": {"contains": ["24000 mm3"]}}
]
```

## The selector picked the wrong number of elements

`count` protects the design: when the selector picks another number of elements, the tool
fails and lists what it picked. Fix the selector (add `type`, `at`, `radius`), or call
`query_geometry` with it to see what it picks and use the `ref` of the one you want.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "at": {"axis": "z", "value": "max"},
    "count": 3}, "radius": 2},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["picked 4 edges, expected 3"]}},
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "circle", "count": 1}, "radius": 2},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["picked 0 edges, expected 1: nothing"]}}
]
```

## A size that does not fit (radius too big, wall too thick: the largest that fits)

A fillet or chamfer bigger than the faces next to it, a shell wall thicker than the part, a
draft angle steeper than the face takes, a press pull deeper than the part: the call fails
and changes nothing. SciForge never builds a smaller value in place of yours (you asked for
an exact value); instead the answer ends with the largest value that does fit, found by
trying smaller values (the same search SciForge's dialogs use when a person drags a value
past what fits): `Largest radius that fits here: 19.99 mm`. Every try rebuilds the design, so
the search has a time limit of a few seconds, every try counted: when it runs out the answer
says `Largest radius found that fits here` (a little more may fit), and on a design so big
that a single try takes longer than that, SciForge does not search at all and says so
(`SciForge did not search for the largest radius that fits`): try a smaller value yourself.
For a value that goes the other way (a press pull into the part, a negative angle) it says
`Furthest ... that fits here`. Use that value or less, or rethink the size. Changing a step
later with `edit_step` answers the same way. A size given as a formula (`expressions`) is
not searched.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "parallel": [0, 0, 1], "count": 4},
    "radius": 30},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["Radius 30 mm is too big here",
     "Largest radius that fits here: 19.99 mm", "give radius 19.99 or less"]}},
  {"tool": "shell", "args": {"faces": {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "count": 1}, "thickness": 25},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["the value does not fit here",
     "Largest thickness that fits here: 9.99 mm"]}},
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "parallel": [0, 0, 1], "count": 4},
    "radius": 5}, "expect": {"contains": ["Its id is 'Fillet1'"]}},
  {"tool": "edit_step", "args": {"step": "Fillet1", "set": {"radius": 30}},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["Largest radius that fits here: 19.99 mm",
     "give set.radius 19.99 or less"]}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}, "expect": {"contains": ["Undo: AI: Fillet 5 mm."]}}
]
```

Note the shell: OpenCASCADE quietly gives the plate back unchanged for a wall thicker than
the part; SciForge sees that the volume did not change and refuses it like any other size
that does not fit.

## It points the wrong way (nothing changed)

An extrude goes along its sketch's normal; a cut from a sketch on the top face (XY with
offset 10) goes up into empty space unless `flip` is true, and the answer ends with
`Warning: no solid changed`. A hole is different: it drills into the part from its sketch,
so from a sketch on the bottom plane (XY, z = 0) it goes up into the part by itself.
`flip: true` makes a hole go along its sketch's normal (up, from a sketch on XY), which
drills into empty space from a sketch on the top face.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "offset": 10,
    "geometry": [{"circle": [30, 20, 5]}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch2", "distance": 4, "operation": "cut"},
   "expect": {"contains": ["24000 mm3", "Warning: no solid changed"]}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch2", "distance": 4, "operation": "cut",
    "flip": true}, "expect": {"contains": ["23685.8 mm3"], "not_contains": ["Warning"]}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"circle": [10, 10, 2]}]}},
  {"tool": "hole", "args": {"sketch": "Sketch3", "diameter": 4, "depth": 5},
   "expect": {"contains": ["23623 mm3"], "not_contains": ["Warning"]}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}},
  {"tool": "hole", "args": {"sketch": "Sketch3", "diameter": 4, "depth": 5,
    "drill_point": "flat"}, "expect": {"contains": ["23623 mm3"], "not_contains": ["Warning"]}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}},
  {"tool": "hole", "args": {"sketch": "Sketch2", "diameter": 4, "depth": 5, "flip": true},
   "expect": {"contains": ["Warning: no solid changed"]}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}}
]
```

## Unknown ids

Ids come from the answers and from `get_timeline`; a typo or an id from another design fails
before anything changes.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch9", "distance": 3},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["there is no step, sketch or body called 'Sketch9'"]}},
  {"tool": "edit_step", "args": {"step": "Fillet7", "set": {"radius": 1}},
   "expect": {"error": true}}
]
```

## No sketch area there

`regions` points must lie inside an area of the sketch (sketch coordinates); `get_sketch`
lists the areas with a point inside each.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 5, "regions": [[70, 70]],
    "operation": "new_body"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["no sketch area contains [70, 70]"]}}
]
```

## A later step broke

Changing an early step (or inserting one with the history marker rolled back) can take away
the faces or edges a later step was built on. The answer names the steps that now fail and
why; `check_design` lists them too. Fix them by editing them (`edit_step`: a fillet takes
`add_edges` to pick edges again), by undoing the change, or by suppressing or deleting the
broken step if it is no longer wanted.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "parallel": [0, 0, 1],
    "not_on_faces": {"type": "cylinder"}, "count": 4}, "radius": 3},
   "expect": {"contains": ["Its id is 'Fillet1'"]}},
  {"tool": "check_design", "args": {}, "expect": {"json": {"ok": true}}},
  {"tool": "edit_step", "args": {"step": "Fillet1", "set": {"radius": 25}},
   "expect": {"error": true}},
  {"tool": "check_design", "args": {}, "expect": {"json": {"ok": true}}}
]
```

An edit that would break its own step is refused and the step stays as it was. Deleting a
step that a later one is built on breaks the later one (the hole's radius differs from the
fillets' 3 mm on purpose: the fillets' top arcs are circles of radius 3 too):

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "offset": 10,
    "geometry": [{"circle": [45, 20, 2.5]}]}},
  {"tool": "hole", "args": {"sketch": "Sketch4", "diameter": 5, "through_all": true},
   "expect": {"contains": ["Its id is 'Hole1'"]}},
  {"tool": "chamfer", "args": {"edges": {"type": "circle", "radius": 2.5,
    "at": {"axis": "z", "value": "max"}, "count": 1}, "distance": 0.5},
   "expect": {"contains": ["Its id is 'Chamfer1'"]}},
  {"tool": "delete_step", "args": {"steps": ["Hole1"]}, "expect": {"contains": ["Chamfer1"]}},
  {"tool": "check_design", "args": {},
   "expect": {"json": {"ok": false, "failed_steps.0.id": "Chamfer1"}}},
  {"tool": "undo", "args": {}},
  {"tool": "check_design", "args": {}, "expect": {"json": {"ok": true}}}
]
```

## Rounding edges that are already smooth

The edge between a fillet and the face next to it is smooth (tangent): there is nothing to
round there, and SciForge says so instead of asking you to pick edges.

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "query_geometry", "args": {"element": "edges", "select": {"type": "line",
    "parallel": [0, 0, 1], "at": {"axis": "x", "value": "max"}}},
   "expect": {"json": {"count": 2}}},
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "parallel": [0, 0, 1],
    "at": {"axis": "x", "value": "max"}, "count": 2}, "radius": 1},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["smooth"]}}
]
```

## The tool needs something that is not there

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "close_design", "args": {"discard_changes": true}},
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "count": 4}, "radius": 1},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["No design is open"]}},
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "Empty"}},
  {"tool": "fillet", "args": {"edges": {"type": "line", "count": 4}, "radius": 1},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["no solid body yet"]}},
  {"tool": "add_drawing_view", "args": {"kind": "projected", "parent": "BaseView",
    "direction": "Top"}, "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["no drawing yet"]}}
]
```

Without the SciForge window (the command line, the MCP server's `--headless` mode) the tools
that need it answer: "This needs the SciForge window, and SciForge is running without one".
`render` works without the window.

## Files

Headless SciForge never replaces a file unless it was started with `--allow-overwrite`
(the window asks the person instead); paths must end in the format's extension; `save` on a
design that was never saved needs `path` (or use `save_as`).

An export answers what the file does not keep of this design, after the file written: `Not
kept in this file:` and one line each (the timeline steps, sketches, hidden bodies,
colours, names, bodies merged into one mesh...), the same list the person sees after File >
Export; nothing is listed when nothing is lost. Inserting or opening a file answers what did
not come in or came in changed (`Not brought in, or changed:`: an open mesh, a 3MF's unit,
DXF texts and hatches, loose faces of a STEP...). These are facts about the file formats, not
errors: decide whether they matter (a STEP for another CAD program never has the timeline).

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "primitive", "args": {"kind": "box", "plane": "XY", "length": 10, "width": 10,
    "height": 10}},
  {"tool": "export", "args": {"format": "step", "path": "{tmp}/box.step"},
   "expect": {"contains": ["box.step", "Not kept in this file:",
     "- the timeline (1 step): the file holds the finished shapes only"]}},
  {"tool": "export", "args": {"format": "step", "path": "{tmp}/box.step"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["already exists"]}},
  {"tool": "export", "args": {"format": "stl", "path": "{tmp}/box.step"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["path must end in .stl for format stl"]}},
  {"tool": "save", "args": {}, "expect": {"error": true}}
]
```

## Parameters and sketches

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "set_parameter", "args": {"name": "w", "value": 10}},
  {"tool": "set_parameter", "args": {"name": "half", "value": "w / 2"}},
  {"tool": "delete_parameter", "args": {"name": "w"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["is used by: the parameter half"]}},
  {"tool": "set_parameter", "args": {"name": "2nd", "value": 1},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["name must start with a letter"]}}
]
```

A parameter that a formula uses (another parameter's, a sketch dimension's or a step's)
cannot be deleted: change those first. A sketch constraint or dimension that conflicts with
the sketch, or that the sketch already says, is refused with the constraints it fights or
repeats, named in words and by index ([sketches.md](sciforge://docs/sketches.md)).

## Over MCP: SciForge busy, closed, or the answer lost

- "SciForge is busy: ..." : a dialog, a sketch or a question is open in SciForge; the person
  has to finish or cancel it.
- "SciForge is not running, or 'Allow AI apps to control SciForge' is off": the documentation
  tools still work (the MCP server answers them itself); the design tools need SciForge.
- "The answer from SciForge was lost ... may or may not have been applied": look at the
  design (`inspect_design`, or `diff_design` since a snapshot) before calling again.

## When the picture and the numbers disagree

Trust the numbers. `render` and `screenshot` are pictures at one size and angle; volumes,
bounding boxes and `query_geometry` facts are exact. A body that looks right can be several
pieces (`check_design` says so) or have a sliver; a body that looks wrong can be a camera
angle. [checking.md](sciforge://docs/checking.md) has the routine.

## Rebuilding a part (Auto Timeline)

The rebuild tools say plainly what is missing. Before `start_rebuild` there is nothing to
describe, compare or finish; a body without a solid (the new design's empty `Body`) cannot be
rebuilt; a body already being rebuilt is not started twice (carry on in its rebuilt body).

```json sciforge-calls
[
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "RebuildTrouble"}},
  {"tool": "describe_reference", "args": {},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["No rebuild is going on", "start_rebuild"]}},
  {"tool": "start_rebuild", "args": {"body": "Body"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["has no solid to rebuild"]}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"rect": [0, 0, 30, 20]}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 5}},
  {"tool": "start_rebuild", "args": {"body": "Body"},
   "expect": {"contains": ["is the reference now", "Its id is 'Body001'"]}},
  {"tool": "start_rebuild", "args": {"body": "Body"},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["is already being rebuilt"]}},
  {"tool": "finish_rebuild", "args": {},
   "expect": {"error": true, "contains": ["Not finished", "still empty",
     "even_if_different"]}}
]
```

- **finish_rebuild says "Not finished"**: it compared first and the rebuild is not done; its
  answer is compare's verdict. Fix what it lists, or give `even_if_different: true` when the
  person accepts the rebuild as it is (a close rebuild of a mesh).
- **The verdict keeps naming a few faces** while no material differs ("No material differs by
  more than a sliver, but 2 faces ... are not matched"): a size or place is slightly off
  (6.02 instead of 6), or the rebuild splits a face differently (two coplanar faces left
  unmerged). Compare the face's description with your step's numbers; `query_geometry` on
  the rebuild shows its faces.
- **A plan step fails**: read the sentence as for any tool (the sections above); the plan's
  ids are the ones SciForge will give, so a step that failed or got another id changes the
  ids of the later steps that name it (`uses` lists them). compare_to_reference afterwards
  says what that step should have made.
- **A mesh is refused** ("not watertight"): the mesh has holes or loose triangles; the person
  repairs it first (MESH tab > Repair), then starts again. ("a mesh of N triangles"): over
  10,000 triangles a mesh is not made into a solid (that takes minutes, and FreeCAD cannot be
  stopped meanwhile); the person reduces it (MESH tab > Reduce) or exports it again from its
  CAD program with a coarser setting.
- **describe_reference lists a thread, a text or free-form faces** in `unrecognized`: they
  are never guessed. A thread: the plan drills the plain hole; add the thread with `thread`
  (modeled) if it is a standard one, compare again, and finish with `even_if_different` when
  the person accepts it as close. A text or a logo standing on (or cut into) a flat face: the
  plan builds the part without it and `unrecognized` says where it is, how big, raised or
  engraved; make a text with `sketch_text` and an extrude (`join` / `cut`), or leave it out
  and finish with `even_if_different` if the person agrees. Other free-form faces (a loft):
  the base is not read; the notes say what to build by hand (`loft`, `sweep`).
- **The person wants to stop the rebuild** (the wrong body, or not now): `delete_step` the
  reference (its id is in start_rebuild's answer): the original is shown again, as it was.
  The rebuilt body stays; `delete_bodies` it if the person does not want it.
- **The base is not read** (`base` is `none`: free-form faces, or no axis fits): the plan has
  only the features, and their steps need the base (a hole there answers "there is no solid
  ... to drill into"). Build the base yourself first (the notes name the axis most of the
  part fits and list the faces that do not), then the plan, then compare.
- **A fillet or chamfer of the plan is "too big here"** (the largest that fits is much
  smaller) and compare then shows small pieces of material along those edges: the original
  rounded the edges before a later cut trimmed the round (the plan rounds last, and may have
  put that cut into an earlier sketch: an opening in the base's profile). Do not take the
  smaller value; make the round before the cut. A cut that is a step of its own:
  `roll_timeline` with `before` it, the fillet, `roll_timeline` to `end`. An opening in an
  earlier sketch: build that sketch without the opening, make the rounds, then cut the
  opening with an extrude of its own (`operation: cut`). Compare again (a 3D-printer part's
  uprights came out at match 1 this way); a sliver face or two left over is fine to finish
  with `even_if_different`.
- **A plan step's selector picks more edges than it expects** ("picked 5 edges, expected 1"):
  the rebuild differs a little from the original there (an earlier step came out slightly
  different: compare says where). `query_geometry` with the selector lists what it picks:
  take the `ref` of the edge at the plan's place, or leave the step and let compare's fixes
  (with refs on the rebuild) take over.
- **describe_reference takes half a minute or more** on a big part (400 faces and more):
  OpenCASCADE's defeaturing cannot be interrupted; wait for the answer (do not call it again
  meanwhile). Its notes say when the time budget ran out and what was skipped.
- **finish_rebuild kept the original** ("kept (hidden) instead of deleted: ... still use it"):
  joints, patterns and sketches that used the original moved onto the rebuild; the ones
  named could not (they use something of the original the rebuild has not). Point them at
  the rebuild by hand, then delete the hidden original.
- **After opening the design again** the rebuild carries on in its rebuilt body (it is the
  active body again); with several rebuilds going on, `activate` the one to work in.
- **The match stays just under 1 on a mesh**: a mesh is flat facets, so a round hole of the
  mesh is a polygon; the faces are matched within the mesh's tolerance and `done` comes when
  every face is within it. Build round holes anyway (the person wants a real part).
- **The verdict starts "(Volumes sampled, ...)"**: OpenCASCADE could not split the two parts
  by each other (a flaw in the imported solid, or faces that almost but not quite lie on each
  other), so compare measured the volumes along rays (about 1 % exact) and lists no regions.
  The faces not matched yet still say where the parts differ; `check_design` on the rebuild
  finds a step that left a sliver. Once the rebuild is right, its faces match the original's
  and compare needs no split at all.
