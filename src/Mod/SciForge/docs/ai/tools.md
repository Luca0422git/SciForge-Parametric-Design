# SciForge AI tools

<!-- Generated from the tool catalogue (src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/ai/catalog) by tools/sciforge/make_ai_docs.py: do not edit by hand. The unit test test_ai_docs_contract.py fails when this file and the catalogue differ. -->

SciForge offers 131 tools to AI apps (through MCP, the built-in chat panel and the command line), listed here in the order tools/list gives them. All lengths are in millimetres (mm) and all angles in degrees. Every tool that changes the design is one undo step named "AI: ..."; errors come back as plain sentences. Each tool has a reference page (reference/<tool>.md: every argument, the answer, the errors and a complete example with its real answer); the resource sciforge://tools has every schema as JSON.

## Help

- [`get_help`](sciforge://docs/reference/get_help.md): Read SciForge's rules for AI tools: overview, selectors (how to pick faces and edges), picks (planes, axes, faces, edges, corners), body_picks, sketches (planes and coordinates), geometry (sketch shapes), curves (paths and rails), steps (ids), expressions (parameters in fields), workflow (how to build and check a part), checking (the tools that check your work with numbers and pictures), docs (where the documentation is and how to search it), tools (every tool by category with its Fusion command).
- [`list_tools`](sciforge://docs/reference/list_tools.md): List every tool by category with its Fusion command, whether it changes the design, and whether it can run right now (and why not: no design open, no solid yet, needs the SciForge window...).
- [`docs_search`](sciforge://docs/reference/docs_search.md): Search SciForge's documentation for AI models: the handbook (how SciForge works, Fusion's ideas mapped to SciForge, coordinates, the timeline, undo, checking your work, failures and how to recover), the selector cookbook, tested recipes for common parts, one reference page per tool (every argument, errors, a real example) and SciForge's own user documentation (cheat sheet, known issues, one Fusion parity spec per feature).
- [`docs_read`](sciforge://docs/reference/docs_read.md): Read one document of SciForge's documentation for AI models, or one section of it: path is what docs_search answers (handbook.md, recipes/bracket.md, reference/extrude.md, user/known-issues.md), optionally with #anchor for one section (or give section).
- [`examples_search`](sciforge://docs/reference/examples_search.md): Find worked examples: recipes (tested sequences of tool calls that build a common part: bracket, enclosure with lid, shaft with keyway, gear pair, flange with bolt pattern, threaded fastener, snap-fit, sheet-like part, revolved knob, lofted handle, surface patch...) and golden models (about 450 small designs in SciForge's design-step language, each with its measured volume and size: proof of what a feature does).

## Designs and files

- [`undo`](sciforge://docs/reference/undo.md): Undo the last change in SciForge (each AI change is one undo step).
- [`redo`](sciforge://docs/reference/redo.md): Redo the change undo took back (one AI call or one SciForge command at a time; a new change after an undo clears what could be redone).
- [`save`](sciforge://docs/reference/save.md): Save the design.
- [`new_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/new_design.md): Start a new, empty design (with one body) and make it the active one.
- [`open_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/open_design.md): Open a design (.FCStd) or a STEP / IGES file as a new design (its components and bodies kept).
- [`save_as`](sciforge://docs/reference/save_as.md): Save the design under a new name (a full path ending in .FCStd); the design then lives there.
- [`close_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/close_design.md): Close a design (default: the active one).
- [`list_designs`](sciforge://docs/reference/list_designs.md): List the open designs: name, label, file, whether it has unsaved changes and which one is active.
- [`switch_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/switch_design.md): Make another open design the active one (the tools then work on it).

## Inspect and measure

- [`get_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/get_design.md): Describe the open SciForge design: its bodies (volume in mm3, bounding box in mm), the timeline steps with their ids (use these ids in profile, sketch and features arguments), the user parameters and the sketches with their areas.
- [`measure`](sciforge://docs/reference/measure.md): Measure between two picks a and b of the current body or the origin: the minimum distance (mm) and, where it makes sense, the angle (degrees), like SciForge's Measure tool; also the X / Y / Z distances, the two nearest points and what each pick is (length, area, radius...).
- [`physical_properties`](sciforge://docs/reference/physical_properties.md): Physical properties of bodies, as Fusion's Properties: volume (mm3), area (mm2), material and density, mass (g), centre of mass and bounding box (mm), number of faces, edges and solids, and whether the solid is valid.

- [`check_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/check_design.md): Check that the design is sound, before saving or exporting it: every body is one valid, closed solid (invalid or open shapes, bodies made of several pieces, empty bodies), timeline steps that failed or warn (with the reason), steps left after the history marker, suppressed steps, sketches with conflicting constraints, and bodies that overlap (Fusion's Interference; interference: false skips it, it takes longest).
- [`diff_design`](sciforge://docs/reference/diff_design.md): What changed in the design since: a snapshot id that inspect_design answered ("S3"), "last_change" (just before the latest change an AI made: what that change did), or a step id (the solid as it was right after that step, compared with now: what the later steps did).

- [`set_study_material`](sciforge://docs/reference/set_study_material.md): Choose the material a body is made of in one study only (Fusion's Study Materials; the design keeps its own): material is a key of the material library (steel, stainless, iron, aluminium, aluminium_6061, copper, titanium, abs, pla, pet, nylon, polycarbonate, acetal, acrylic, polypropylene, ptfe, peek, wood, glass) or same_as_model to go back to the body's physical material.

- [`precheck_study`](sciforge://docs/reference/precheck_study.md): Check a study before solving it, like Fusion's Pre-check traffic light: ready (green), caution (yellow: it solves, but read the warnings) or cannot solve (red: what to fix), with every message as a sentence: missing constraints or loads, materials without the values a stress study needs, constraints or loads whose faces are gone, bodies that would fly away, bodies that overlap.
- [`solve_study`](sciforge://docs/reference/solve_study.md): Solve a study on this computer (Gmsh meshes it, CalculiX solves it; Fusion solves in Autodesk's cloud): seconds for a simple part, minutes for a fine mesh; SciForge waits until it is done (timeout, seconds: then it gives up).
- [`study_results`](sciforge://docs/reference/study_results.md): The results of a study's last solve as numbers: the minimum and maximum of every result (safety factor, von Mises, 1st / 3rd principal and the stress components in MPa, displacement in mm, strain) with where they are [x, y, z] mm, per body (material, largest stress and displacement, lowest safety factor), the reaction force at every constraint (N), the mesh, and the verdict in a sentence (lowest safety factor against target: "lowest safety factor 1.4 at (x, y, z) on Body1: below 2"; below 1 the part would bend for good).

## Rebuild with a timeline

- [`start_rebuild`](sciforge://docs/reference/start_rebuild.md): Start rebuilding a part that has no timeline as real, editable timeline steps (Auto Timeline): an imported STEP body, any solid body, or a mesh body (made into a solid first; an open or broken mesh is refused).
- [`describe_reference`](sciforge://docs/reference/describe_reference.md): What the reference of a rebuild is made of, read by SciForge from its faces: summary (volume, area, size, counts, the kinds of faces), base (the base shape: an extrude with its plane, profile and distance, a revolve, a box...), features (holes, counterbores, pockets, bosses, slots, fillets, chamfers, patterns, each with its numbers and the faces it explains), plan (tool calls in Fusion's order: base shape, cuts and bosses, holes, patterns, chamfers, fillets last; each step's args pass the tool's own check, so send them as they are, adjusting ids the answers give), unrecognized (faces it could not read, with selectors and why), confidence (0..1) and notes.
- [`compare_to_reference`](sciforge://docs/reference/compare_to_reference.md): How far the rebuilt body is from the reference, to call after every feature: match (common volume / union volume; 1 is identical), volume (reference, rebuilt, common, missing, extra in mm3), missing (material of the original the rebuild lacks) and extra (material the rebuild has and the original does not: a hole not cut yet is extra material shaped like a cylinder), each region with its volume, centre, box, kind, what it looks like ('a round hole about 6 mm across, 10 deep', 'a rounded edge, radius about 2', 'a block 10 x 5 x 3') and, when SciForge is sure, fix: the tool call that makes it (a Single Hole, a fillet of exactly those edges); groups (equal regions together, with one fix for all of them); faces (how many of the original's faces the rebuild matches by geometry, and the unmatched ones of each side with a description and a selector); deviation (how far the surfaces are apart, max and mean, mm); size_notes; done (match >= 0.999, every face of the original matched and none of the rebuild left over); and verdict: what to do next, in words.
- [`finish_rebuild`](sciforge://docs/reference/finish_rebuild.md): Finish a rebuild: the rebuilt body takes the original's name, component and place, with its timeline; the original (the featureless body or the mesh body) is deleted, or kept hidden as '<name> (original)' with keep_original: true; the reference is removed (keep_reference: true keeps it, hidden).

## Shared rules

<a id="help-overview"></a>

### overview

SciForge is a parametric CAD program (built on FreeCAD) that works like Autodesk Fusion. These tools build and change the design open in SciForge step by step in its timeline, with the same code as SciForge's own dialogs; every change is one undo step (show_hide and activate are none). All lengths are in millimetres (mm) and all angles in degrees. Faces and edges are picked with selectors that describe their geometry (get_help topic selectors), never by internal names. Steps, sketches, bodies and components are named by the ids the tools report and get_design / get_timeline list (for example 'Sketch1', 'Extrude2'). A body is named by any step in it (the step that made it, usually). Errors come back as plain sentences: read them, fix the arguments and try again; a size that does not fit (a fillet radius, a shell thickness, a draft angle...) is refused with the largest value that does, never built smaller in its place. Read-only tools (inspect_design, query_geometry, check_design, render, diff_design, get_design, get_timeline, get_step, measure, physical_properties...) never change anything.

A selector picks edges or faces by their geometry, the way a person would click them (never by names like "Edge7"). It is an object; every filter is optional, they combine with AND and apply in this order:

  type: for edges line, circle, ellipse or bspline; for faces plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus, bspline or extrusion (the side of an extruded spline or ellipse).

  normal: [x, y, z] (faces only) flat faces whose outward normal points this way.

  parallel: [x, y, z] straight edges parallel to this direction (either sense).

  along: [x, y, z] (faces only) faces running along this direction: the side walls of a part extruded that way (flat, round or free-form).

  radius: a number (mm): circles, cylinders and spheres with this radius.

  on_faces: a face selector (edges only): the edges that bound the faces it picks.

  not_on_faces: a face selector (edges only): the edges that do NOT bound those faces.

  at: {"axis": "x" | "y" | "z", "value": "max" | "min" | a number in mm}, or a list of them: keeps the elements whose centre lies at the extreme (or at that coordinate) along the axis, among those the filters above kept; a list applies each condition in turn.

  all: true: every edge or face (combine with nothing else except count).

  count: a whole number: the pick must contain exactly this many, or the tool fails instead of changing the wrong geometry. Always give it.

  any_of: [selector, ...]: the union of several selectors (each may have its own count).

  body: the id of the body the selector was made for (query_geometry's refs carry it): a tool that works on another body (the active one) refuses it instead of changing that body; activate this body first.

Examples: the 4 top edges of a box {"type": "line", "at": {"axis": "z", "value": "max"}, "count": 4}; the top face {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "count": 1}; one specific edge {"type": "line", "parallel": [0, 1, 0], "at": [{"axis": "x", "value": 5}, {"axis": "z", "value": 5}], "count": 1}.

Selectors look at the current body as it is now; call get_design first to see its size.

### picks

A pick is one of {"plane": "XY"|"XZ"|"YZ"}, {"axis": "X"|"Y"|"Z"}, {"origin": true}, {"face": face selector}, {"edge": edge selector}, {"vertex": [x, y, z]} (a corner of the part) or {"construct": id} (a construction plane, axis or point made earlier). Face and edge selectors must pick exactly one element of the current body.

<a id="help-body_picks"></a>

### body_picks

A body pick is "XY" | "XZ" | "YZ" (an origin plane), "X" | "Y" | "Z" (an origin axis), {"face": selector, "of": step id}, {"edge": selector, "of": step id}, {"vertex": {"at": ...}, "of": step id} (a corner: the vertex selector takes only "at" conditions) or {"body": step id} (a whole body). "of" names a step whose body the selector looks at; left out, the body you are working on.

<a id="help-sketches"></a>

### sketches

Sketch planes are the origin planes: XY (normal +Z, sketch x/y are X/Y), XZ (normal -Y, sketch x/y are X/Z) and YZ (normal +X, sketch x/y are Y/Z). offset moves the sketch along that normal. Instead of a plane you can give face, a selector that picks exactly one flat face of the part; the sketch's x/y axes are then the ones SciForge gives that face. Sketch on the face when the sketch must follow it (holes in a top face whose height may change); an origin plane with an offset gives plain coordinates and stays where it is.

<a id="help-geometry"></a>

### geometry

Each geometry item is an object with exactly one of: rect [x0, y0, x1, y1] (two opposite corners), center_rect [cx, cy, width, height], circle [cx, cy, radius], polyline [[x, y], ...] (at least 3 corners, always closed), polygon {center: [x, y], radius, sides, rotation} (a regular polygon with its corners on that radius; rotation in degrees), slot [x1, y1, x2, y2, width] (a straight slot between two centre points), line [x0, y0, x1, y1] (one open line: it makes no area). Optional name: dimensions <name>.width, <name>.height, <name>.x, <name>.y (rectangles) or <name>.diameter, <name>.x, <name>.y (circles). Shapes inside each other make separate areas (a circle inside a rectangle makes a ring area and a disc area); extrude and revolve without regions use the outer areas with the shapes inside them as holes (that rectangle with its circle extrudes as a plate with a hole). Also: ellipse [cx, cy, major, minor] (major radius along x, the larger), spline_loop [[x, y], ...] (a closed smooth curve through at least 3 points), segments [{line: [x0, y0, x1, y1]} | {arc: [cx, cy, r, a0, a1]} | {spline: [[x, y], ...], tangents: [[tx, ty], [tx, ty]]}, ...] (a closed chain of lines, arcs counter-clockwise from a0 to a1 degrees, and open splines; each piece starts where the one before ends).

<a id="help-curves"></a>

### curves

Curves (paths, rails, rib curves) are given as "<sketch id>" (every curve of that sketch), {"sketch": id, "at": [x, y]} (the curve through that sketch point and the curves joined smoothly to it, like Fusion's chain selection; "chain": false for that curve alone; "at" may also be a list of points) or {"edge": edge selector} (edges of the part as it is now).

<a id="help-steps"></a>

### steps

Steps, sketches, bodies and components are named by the ids the tools report and get_design / get_timeline list (for example 'Sketch1', 'Extrude2'). A body is named by any step in it (the step that made it, usually).

<a id="help-expressions"></a>

### expressions

Value fields can follow a parameter: expressions {field: formula} (for example {"distance": "width / 2"}) keeps the field driven by that formula. User parameters are made with set_parameter; formulas use their names with + - * / ( ) and mm / deg units.

<a id="help-workflow"></a>

### workflow

1. inspect_design (or get_design, list_designs / new_design / open_design) to see what is there. 2. Build: create_sketch on a plane, then extrude / revolve / sweep / loft; primitive, coil, pipe, gear make solids directly; hole, thread, fillet, chamfer, shell, draft change the solid. 3. After every change check the numbers it answers (volumes, bounding boxes); diff_design since last_change says exactly what it did; query_geometry lists the faces / edges a selector picks (with a stable ref for each) before you fillet or chamfer them; check_design says whether the design is sound; render returns a picture (highlight shows what a selector picks). Trust the numbers first, the picture second. 4. Name things with set_parameter and expressions so the design stays easy to change; edit_step and set_model_parameter change what exists; get_timeline shows the history and roll_timeline / suppress_step / move_step / delete_step change it. 5. undo takes back the last change. 6. save / save_as / export / export_drawing write files.

<a id="help-checking"></a>

### checking

Check your work with numbers before trusting a picture. inspect_design: every body (valid?, volume, area, bounding box, centre of mass, faces / edges / corners), every step (state, error message, values), parameters, components, joints, the selection; it answers a snapshot id. diff_design since that id, since last_change or since a step id: what changed (bodies, steps, parameters). query_geometry: the faces / edges / corners a selector picks with their facts (type, area / length, normal, axis, radius, centre) and a ref, a selector that picks exactly that element: give it to fillet / chamfer / shell / draft, or pick ({"face": ref}) to measure / create_sketch. check_design: invalid or open solids, bodies in several pieces, failed steps, overlapping bodies. measure: the distance / angle between two picks, or the size of one. render: a PNG picture (iso, front, top... or a direction), highlight marks faces / edges in orange; it works without the window too (renderer software).

<a id="help-docs"></a>

### docs

SciForge's documentation for AI models is searchable: docs_search finds the sections that match a few words (with a snippet and a path#anchor), docs_read reads a document or one section, examples_search finds tested recipes and golden models by words, tool, op or tag. Start with handbook.md (how SciForge works, Fusion's ideas mapped to it, coordinates, undo, checking, recovering from failures), selectors.md (the selector cookbook) and recipes/index.md (step-by-step parts); reference/<tool>.md has every argument of a tool with a real example; user/ has SciForge's documentation for people. Over MCP the same documents are resources sciforge://docs/<path>, and sciforge://handbook is all of them in one file.
