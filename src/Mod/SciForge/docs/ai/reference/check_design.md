# `check_design`: Check design

<!-- Generated from the tool catalogue (src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/ai/catalog) by tools/sciforge/make_ai_docs.py: do not edit by hand. The unit test test_ai_docs_contract.py fails when this file and the catalogue differ. -->

Fusion: INSPECT > Interference + the timeline's warnings. Category: Inspect and measure. Read-only. Needs an open design.

## What it does

Check that the design is sound, before saving or exporting it: every body is one valid, closed solid (invalid or open shapes, bodies made of several pieces, empty bodies), timeline steps that failed or warn (with the reason), steps left after the history marker, suppressed steps, sketches with conflicting constraints, and bodies that overlap (Fusion's Interference; interference: false skips it, it takes longest). Answers ok (true when there are no problems), the problems and warnings in plain sentences, and the facts behind them. bodies: only these (step ids).

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Unit | Default | Limits | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `interference` | boolean |  | `true` |  | look for bodies that overlap |
| `bodies` | array of strings |  |  | at least 1 item(s) | only these bodies (default: all) |

## Answer

A plain sentence, then JSON with: `ok`, `problems`, `warnings`, `bodies`, `failed_steps`, `interference`, `sketches`. The example below shows a real one.

## Errors

- Without an open design: `No design is open: call new_design or open_design first (or create_sketch, which starts a new design).`
- Arguments of the wrong type, out of their limits or not in the table are refused the same way, each problem in a sentence ("radius must be a number above 0").
- When it cannot be done the answer says why in a sentence (isError true) and nothing changes.

## Example 1: is the design sound

Starting from this design (made by these calls):

```json
[
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "Example"}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"rect": [0, 0, 60, 40], "name": "base"}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 10}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "offset": 10, "geometry": [{"circle": [30, 20, 4]}]}},
  {"tool": "hole", "args": {"sketch": "Sketch2", "diameter": 8, "through_all": true}}
]
```

The call:

```json
{"tool": "check_design", "args": {}}
```

The answer:

```text

 ],

 "sketches": [

 ]
}
```
