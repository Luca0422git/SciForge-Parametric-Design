Fusion: SOLID > CREATE > Hole. Category: Create (SOLID). Changes the design (one undo step). Its undo step is named like "AI: Hole 6 mm". Needs a solid body.
It builds the design step(s) `hole`, `hole_points`, `hole_at` (the golden models' step language).

## What it does

Drill holes into the part (SciForge's Hole). First create_sketch on the face where the holes start (for example plane XY with offset = the top's height) with a small circle at each hole centre; the holes go at the circles' centres, whatever their size; the holes go into the part (also from a sketch under it). Give depth or through_all. Optional counterbore {diameter, depth} or countersink {diameter, angle} (angle in degrees, default 90). Single Hole instead of a sketch: face (the flat face clicked) and at ([x, y, z] on it), with up to two references [{edge: edge selector, distance}] that place the centre from straight edges. All of Fusion's Hole dialog: hole_type simple | counterbore | countersink (cbore_diameter, cbore_depth, csink_diameter, csink_angle), extent distance | all | to (to: a plane or face), drill_point flat | angle (drill_angle), tap_type simple | clearance | tapped | taper, standard iso | ansi, size / designation (e.g. M6x1, 1/4-20 UNC), fit close | normal | loose, fastener socket_head | hex_head | countersunk, fastener_head (head pocket sized for it), taper_kind npt | bspt with taper_size, thread_class, thread_direction right | left, modeled (real thread), full_tap, tap_depth, flip. All lengths are in millimetres (mm) and all angles in degrees.

## Answer

On success: `Done: <undo title>. Its id is '<id>'. Bodies now: <each solid body's volume in mm3 and size in mm>.` (some steps report no id); then `These steps now fail: ...` when the change broke later steps, and `Warning: no solid changed ...` when it changed no solid at all. On failure nothing changes and the answer is `Not done (<undo title>): <the reason>`.

## Errors

- Without a solid body: `The design has no solid body yet: make one first (create_sketch + extrude, or primitive).`
- Called without arguments, the arguments are refused before anything runs: `Not done: give sketch (a sketch with the hole centres) or face + at; give either depth or through_all: true; diameter is missing (or give tap_type with a designation / size).`
- Arguments of the wrong type, out of their limits or not in the table are refused the same way, each problem in a sentence ("radius must be a number above 0").
- When SciForge cannot build the step (a selector that picks another number of elements than `count`, a size that does not fit, an id that does not exist), the answer is `Not done (<undo title>): <reason>` and nothing changes; [troubleshooting](sciforge://docs/troubleshooting.md) lists the usual causes.

## Example 1: a single 6 mm hole, 8 mm deep, on the top face

Starting from this design (made by these calls):

```json
[
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "Example"}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"rect": [0, 0, 60, 40], "name": "base"}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 10}}
]
```

The call:

```json
{"tool": "hole", "args": {"face": {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "at": {"axis": "z", "value": "max"}, "count": 1}, "at": [30, 20, 10], "diameter": 6, "depth": 8}}
```

The answer:

```text
Done: AI: Hole 6 mm. Its id is 'Hole1'. Bodies now: Body1: 23773.8 mm3, 60 x 40 x 10 mm.
```

## Example 2: a counterbored hole for an M5 socket head screw

Starting from this design (made by these calls):

```json
[
  {"tool": "new_design", "args": {"name": "Example"}},
  {"tool": "create_sketch", "args": {"plane": "XY", "geometry": [{"rect": [0, 0, 60, 40], "name": "base"}]}},
  {"tool": "extrude", "args": {"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 10}}
]
```

The call:

```json
{"tool": "hole", "args": {"face": {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "at": {"axis": "z", "value": "max"}, "count": 1}, "at": [15, 20, 10], "diameter": 5.5, "through_all": true, "counterbore": {"diameter": 10, "depth": 5.5}}}
```

The answer:

```text
Done: AI: Hole 5.5 mm. Its id is 'Hole1'. Bodies now: Body1: 23461.1 mm3, 60 x 40 x 10 mm.
```

## More argument examples

- 6 mm holes through the part at Sketch2's circle centres:
  `{"sketch": "Sketch2", "diameter": 6, "through_all": true}`
- one tapped M6 hole 12 mm deep, clicked on the top face:
  `{"face": {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "count": 1}, "at": [20, 10, 10], "tap_type": "tapped", "designation": "M6x1", "depth": 12}`
