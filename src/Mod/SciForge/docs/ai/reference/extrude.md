Fusion: SOLID > CREATE > Extrude. Category: Create (SOLID). Changes the design (one undo step). Its undo step is named like "AI: Extrude 10 mm". Needs an open design.
It builds the design step(s) `extrude` (the golden models' step language).

## What it does

Extrude a sketch's areas into a solid (SciForge's Extrude). distance goes along the sketch normal; flip: true goes the other way, for cuts too: a cut from a sketch lying on top of the part needs flip: true. regions picks some areas by a point inside each ([x, y] in sketch coordinates); without it the outer areas are used and shapes inside them are holes (a point in the ring and one in the disc fill it). direction one_side (default), symmetric (distance is the whole length, half on each side) or two_sides (distance one way, distance2 the other). through_all goes through the whole part instead of a distance. taper in degrees. More of Fusion's dialog: face (a flat face of the part as the profile, instead of a sketch), more_profiles (more sketches extruded together), to (Extent To Object: a plane, a face or a body to stop at), extent2 / to2 / taper2 (side two), measurement (symmetric: whole or half length), start (profile, offset with start_offset, or object with start_from), thin {location side1|center|side2, thickness, location2, thickness2} (a Thin Extrude: a wall along the profile; with curves it extrudes open sketch curves), bodies (Bodies to Cut / Join: auto or step ids), extend / object_offset (To Object). All lengths are in millimetres (mm) and all angles in degrees.

| `thin.location` | `side1` \| `center` \| `side2` |  | `"side1"` |  |  |

| `thin.thickness2` | number | mm |  | > 0 | side two's wall thickness (mm) |
| `bodies` | string or array |  |  |  | "auto": every body the feature passes through is cut / joined (what the dialog lists by itself); or a list of step ids: exactly those bodies (the dialog's "Bodies to Cut" row) |
| `extend` | `face` \| `adjacent` \| `body` \| `through` |  |  |  | To Object: how the target face is extended |
| `extend2` | `face` \| `adjacent` \| `body` \| `through` |  |  |  | side two's extend |
| `object_offset` | number | mm |  |  | To Object: stop this far from the object (mm) |
| `object_offset2` | number | mm |  |  | side two's object offset (mm) |

## Answer

On success: `Done: <undo title>. Its id is '<id>'. Bodies now: <each solid body's volume in mm3 and size in mm>.` (some steps report no id); then `These steps now fail: ...` when the change broke later steps, and `Warning: no solid changed ...` when it changed no solid at all. On failure nothing changes and the answer is `Not done (<undo title>): <the reason>`.

## Errors

- Without an open design: `No design is open: call new_design or open_design first (or create_sketch, which starts a new design).`
- Called without arguments, the arguments are refused before anything runs: `Not done: give profile (a sketch id) or face (a flat face selector), one of them; distance is missing (or set through_all to true).`
- Arguments of the wrong type, out of their limits or not in the table are refused the same way, each problem in a sentence ("radius must be a number above 0").
- When SciForge cannot build the step (a selector that picks another number of elements than `count`, a size that does not fit, an id that does not exist), the answer is `Not done (<undo title>): <reason>` and nothing changes; [troubleshooting](sciforge://docs/troubleshooting.md) lists the usual causes.
- A size that does not fit (`taper`, `taper2`, `thin.thickness`) is refused, never built smaller in its place: the reason ends with the largest value that fits, found by trying smaller ones (`Largest radius that fits here: 19.99 mm (30 mm does not; ... give radius 19.99 or less).`; `Furthest ... that fits here` for a value below 0). A value given as a formula is not searched. See [troubleshooting](sciforge://docs/troubleshooting.md#a-size-that-does-not-fit).

```

## More argument examples

- a 10 mm solid from Sketch1's areas:
  `{"profile": "Sketch1", "distance": 10}`
- cut a sketch lying on the top face down through the whole part:
  `{"profile": "Sketch2", "through_all": true, "operation": "cut", "flip": true}`
- extrude up to the top face (Extent To Object):
  `{"profile": "Sketch3", "to": {"face": {"normal": [0, 0, 1], "count": 1}}, "operation": "join"}`
