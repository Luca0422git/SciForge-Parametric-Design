# `examples_search`: Search examples

<!-- Generated from the tool catalogue (src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/ai/catalog) by tools/sciforge/make_ai_docs.py: do not edit by hand. The unit test test_ai_docs_contract.py fails when this file and the catalogue differ. -->

Fusion: (Fusion's sample designs, for SciForge). Category: Help. Read-only. Needs nothing.

## What it does

Find worked examples: recipes (tested sequences of tool calls that build a common part: bracket, enclosure with lid, shaft with keyway, gear pair, flange with bolt pattern, threaded fastener, snap-fit, sheet-like part, revolved knob, lofted handle, surface patch...) and golden models (about 450 small designs in SciForge's design-step language, each with its measured volume and size: proof of what a feature does). Filter by words (query), a tool name (tool), a design-step op (op, e.g. blend_fillet), a tag or kind (recipe or golden). Read a hit with docs_read (its uri).

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Unit | Default | Limits | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | string |  |  |  | words, e.g. 'counterbore hole pattern' |
| `tool` | string |  |  |  | only examples that use this tool, e.g. circular_pattern |
| `op` | string |  |  |  | only golden models with this design-step op, e.g. sf_shell |
| `tag` | string |  |  |  | only examples with this tag, e.g. fillet |
| `kind` | `all` \| `recipe` \| `golden` |  | `"all"` |  | which examples |
| `limit` | integer |  | `10` | >= 1, <= 50 | how many to answer |

## Answer

A plain sentence, then JSON with: `results`, `total`. The example below shows a real one.

## Errors

- Called without arguments, the arguments are refused before anything runs: `Not done: give query, tool, op, tag or kind (recipe / golden): what to look for.`
- Arguments of the wrong type, out of their limits or not in the table are refused the same way, each problem in a sentence ("radius must be a number above 0").
- When it cannot be done the answer says why in a sentence (isError true) and nothing changes.

## Example 1: examples of a flange with holes around a circle

Starting from SciForge with no design open.

The call:

```json
{"tool": "examples_search", "args": {"query": "bolt circle flange", "limit": 3}}
```

The answer:
