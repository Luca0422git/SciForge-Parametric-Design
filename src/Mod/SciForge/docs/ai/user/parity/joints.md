# Parity spec: Assemble > Joints (outline 7.10; plan.md "Next" item 3)

Implemented in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`: `joints_core.py` (pure maths, unit tested),
`joints.py` (the document side, no Qt: joints, grounds, rigid groups, joint origins,
positions, the solver check, the delete / component watch), `joints_ui.py` (the dialogs,
the snap hover, the animation, the commands), plus the browser (`browser_core.py`,
`browser_ui.py`), the timeline kinds (`timeline_core.py`), the ribbon (`ribbon_config.py`),
the J key (`config.py`) and the icons (`tools/sciforge/make_icons.py`).
Wave 4 (branch `sf/joints-2`) added `motion_core.py` (pure maths of dragging, motion links,
contact and motion studies, unit tested), `joints_drag.py` (Component Drag in the canvas,
reached through `selection_ui`'s view filter) and `joints_motion_ui.py` (Motion Link, Contact
Sets, Motion Study, the SELECT menu's Component Drag tick), the position modes (Between Two
Faces, Two Edge Intersection) in the Joint, As-built Joint and Joint Origin dialogs, nested
components that move on their own, and joints that need no ground.
Tests: `SciForgeTests/unit/test_joints_core.py` (28 tests), `test_motion_core.py` (31 tests)
and ten GUI scenarios with real clicks (see **Tests** at the end).

Status: **built and tested with real clicks, not yet signed off by Luca.** Everything marked
**(assumed)** is a guess at a Fusion detail no source settled; everything marked
**(SciForge)** is a deliberate difference, explained.

## Sources (read before building; nothing copied from them but the behaviour)

Autodesk's own help and learning pages (reached through search-result excerpts: the help site
itself is not reachable from the build sandbox), forum answers by Autodesk staff, and one
third-party guide:

1. Autodesk Fusion help, *Create a joint* (ASM-CREATE-JOINT): the Position tab's Mode
   (Simple = "Select a Snap point to place the joint origin"; Between Two Faces = "Select
   Plane 1 and Plane 2 to center the joint origin between them, then select a Snap point";
   Two Edge Intersection), Angle ("Drag the rotation manipulator handle or enter an exact
   angle"), Offset X/Y/Z ("Drag the move manipulator handle or enter an exact distance"),
   Flip ("Click to flip Component 1 over the Joint Origin"); the Motion tab: Type, a Rotate
   axis for Revolute, a Slide axis for Slider, both for Cylindrical / Pin-Slot, Pitch and Yaw
   axes for Ball ("a gimbal with three nested rotations").
2. Autodesk Fusion help, *Create an as-built joint* (ASM-CREATE-AS-BUILT-JOINT): components
   stay where they are; for any type but Rigid a Position (Simple / Between Two Faces / Two
   Edge Intersection); Maximum ("Specify the maximum limit on the range of motion"), Rest
   ("Specify the resting position for components within the range of motion"), Preview Motion.
3. Autodesk Fusion help, *Create a joint origin* (ASM-CREATE-JOINT-ORIGIN) and Autodesk's
   assemblies course: Simple mode "Select a Snap point"; on a face the snap icons mark
   "endpoints, edge or arc midpoints, the face centroid, and arc centers".
4. Autodesk Fusion help, *Ground and unground components* (ASM-GROUND-TO-PARENT-COMMAND):
   right-click the component in the Browser; Ground To Parent / Unground From Parent; a
   grounded component is "marked with an anchor icon" (Autodesk blog); grounding "prevents
   that component from moving and provides a stable reference point".
5. Autodesk Fusion help, *Create a rigid group of components* (ASM-CREATE-RIGID-GROUP): pick
   two or more components in the canvas or Browser, "Include Child Components", OK; "the group
   is locked in place and appears as a feature in the Timeline"; right-click the feature >
   Edit Rigid Group to add or remove components.
6. Autodesk Fusion help, *Capture or revert position of components* (ASM-CAPTURE-POSITION) and
   the blog *How To Use Capture or Revert*: after a component is moved the POSITION panel
   appears in the toolbar; Capture Position records the moved components' positions "stored on
   the timeline as a featured position"; Revert returns them "to their most recently captured
   position", no dialog; a command that depends on positions (Joint Origin, Joint) asks
   whether to capture or revert first.
7. Autodesk Learn, *Create realistic motion in assemblies* and *Define joints for component
   relationships*: right-click a joint in the Joints folder: Drive Joints ("giving it a very
   specific position"), Edit Joint, Edit Motion Limits (Minimum, Maximum, Rest; "Flags show on
   the canvas"; limits "only affect the specified joint"), Lock Motion, Suppress, Animate
   Joint ("the movement of the joint only"), Animate Joint Relationships; "Drag the gear to
   preview its circular motion".
8. Autodesk blog *Joints vs. Mates, and Moving Things Around in Autodesk Fusion* and an
   Autodesk engineering director on the forum (*rigid joint discrepancy in maintaining spatial
   relationships*): "The entire difference between Joint and As-Built Joint is that the latter
   does not require you to select geometry"; an as-built joint cannot follow later geometry
   changes.
9. Autodesk blog *Joints and constraints in Autodesk Fusion* and the Noble Desktop guide
   *Understanding Joints in Fusion 360*: the seven types and their degrees of freedom; "hit
   Animate to continue the animation"; Fusion animates the two parts after the second pick;
   Esc stops an animation.
10. Fusion API reference: `JointTypes` (Rigid 0, Revolute 1, Slider 2, Cylindrical 3,
    PinSlot 4, Planar 5, Ball 6), `JointLimits` (isMinimumValueEnabled / isMaximumValueEnabled
    / isRestValueEnabled), `RigidGroups.add(occurrences, includeChildren)`.

Wave 4 (drag, motion, positions; read 2026-10-14 through search excerpts, the Autodesk sites
themselves were not reachable from the sandbox):

11. Autodesk blog *How to Select Multiple Components in Fusion 360* and Autodesk Community
    threads *Accidentally moving objects without selecting move*, *Turn off dragable
    components*, *Moving Bodies/Components by Mouse*: "Component Drag" is a tick in the Select
    menu; "click-and-drag over an object is intended as component drag so that joint-based
    mechanisms can be tested by dragging" (an Autodesk engineering director), which is why a
    window selection cannot start on a component; with the timeline (parametric design) a
    drag moves components, in a direct design the Select menu's Component Drag must be on;
    "dragging only works on components, not bodies".
12. Noble Desktop, *Applying Joints and As-Built Joints*: a grounded part "cannot move,
    whether it is acted upon by a joint or a click and drag".
13. Autodesk Fusion help *Capture or revert position of components* (ASM-CAPTURE-POSITION),
    Autodesk Community *Capturing position* (Autodesk support: "Fusion 360 is just warning
    you that it will create a snapshot if you select Continue or revert to the original
    position if you select Revert") and the Autodesk blog *How To Use Capture or Revert*:
    after components moved, a command that depends on their position (Joint Origin) shows a
    message that components moved and asks to capture or revert; capture and revert act on
    all moved components together.
14. Autodesk Fusion help *Create a joint*, *Create an as-built joint*, *Create a joint
    origin* (ASM-CREATE-JOINT, -AS-BUILT-JOINT, -JOINT-ORIGIN): Between Two Faces "Select
    Plane 1 and Plane 2 to center the joint origin between them, then select a Snap point";
    Two Edge Intersection "Select Edge 1 and a non-parallel Edge 2 to locate the joint
    origin at the extended intersection".
15. Autodesk blog *Quick tip: Adding joints between two faces*: works with every joint
    type; for faces at an angle "Fusion 360 will find a midplane between the two angled
    faces"; Autodesk Community *Can't select specific faces with Joint "between two faces"*:
    two faces in one plane give nothing between them. Autodesk blog *2 Ways To Upgrade Your
    Autodesk Fusion Models*: Two Edge Intersection is for where (curved) edges would meet.
16. Autodesk Learn *Create realistic motion in assemblies* / *Mechanical assemblies
    fundamentals*: ASSEMBLE > Motion Link, "prompted to select the joints"; a slider gets a
    distance and a revolute an angle ("0.394 in" of slide per "360 deg"); gears by angles
    (720 / 360); "a Motion Link image is added to the timeline and to the Joints folder in
    the browser". Autodesk Community (Jeff Strater, Autodesk): the Reverse check box shows
    once the second joint is picked and only sets how the two joints move relative to each
    other. Fusion API `MotionLinkInput.isReversed` (default False).
17. Autodesk Fusion help *Create contact sets* (ASM-NEW-CONTACT-SET) and Autodesk Learn:
    ASSEMBLE > Enable Contact Sets; New Contact Set: two or more components; "contact sets
    enable the assembly to move freely until selected components come in contact"; a
    Contacts folder in the browser; a set can be suppressed; Autodesk Community: once on,
    moving joints stops bodies passing through each other.
18. Autodesk Learn *Joints and motion studies* / *Create realistic motion in assemblies* and
    Autodesk Community threads on motion studies: ASSEMBLE > Motion Study, pick joints; a
    value at step 0, another at step 100 (720 deg = two turns); Play / Restart, a Speed
    slider, Mode Loop (plays until paused); "a motion study folder is created at the top of
    the browser"; motion studies take all related joints (links) into account.

## What Fusion does (the behaviour copied)

### Joint (J; ASSEMBLE > Joint)

1. The dialog opens with the Component 1 snap box waiting (blue). Hover a component: snap
   points light up on the element under the mouse: a face's centre, its corners, the midpoints
   of its straight edges and the centres of its round edges; an edge's ends, middle and (for
   an arc) centre; a corner itself. The nearest snap is highlighted and a small triad shows
   where the joint origin would be and how it points (Z along the face normal / edge / axis).
2. Click: component 1's joint origin is set; the triad stays. The Component 2 box waits.
3. Click a snap on **another** component: component 1 moves so that its joint origin sits on
   component 2's (faces mate: the two Z axes point against each other), then the motion is
   previewed: the joint animates through its freedom and comes back.
4. Position tab: Mode (Simple; Between Two Faces and Two Edge Intersection), Offset X / Y / Z
   (along component 2's joint origin axes), Angle (about its Z), Flip (component 1 turned over
   the joint origin). Motion tab: Type (Rigid, Revolute, Slider, Cylindrical, Pin-Slot, Planar,
   Ball) with the axis choices of (1), Animate, and the motion limits (Minimum / Maximum /
   Rest). OK / Enter keeps it, Cancel / Esc puts component 1 back.
5. The joint appears in the browser's **Joints** folder and as a step in the timeline;
   double-click (Edit Joint) reopens the dialog. Right-click: Edit Joint, Edit Joint Limits,
   Drive Joints, Animate Joint, Suppress, Delete.
6. Picking a new Type plays the new motion once (the same preview as after the second
   pick); the Animate button plays it until it is pressed again.
7. A pick can be cleared (the box's clear button): the component that moved goes back and
   the box waits again **(SciForge: the whole dialog's change is taken back and a fresh undo
   step starts, so a ground the joint added goes too)**.
8. A joint origin made with Joint Origin can be picked in the 3D view or on its browser row
   (the snap is the joint origin itself).

### As-Built Joint (ASSEMBLE > As-built Joint)

Pick two components (click anywhere on each, or in the browser), choose the Type; for any type
but Rigid pick a Position (a snap point: the axis / origin of the motion). Nothing moves. The
joint does not follow later geometry changes of the picked position's part (as-built = "where
they are now").

### Joint Origin (ASSEMBLE > Joint Origin)

One snap pick with the same hover, plus Offset X / Y / Z, Angle, Flip: a joint origin (a small
triad) stored in the component, listed in the browser (Fusion: a Joint Origins folder in the
component) and in the timeline. It can be clicked as a snap by Joint and As-Built Joint.

### Ground / Unground

Right-click a component (browser): Ground; it cannot move (not by a joint, not by a drag);
the row shows an anchor. Unground frees it. Fusion needs no grounded component for a joint to
work, and neither does SciForge since wave 4: FreeCAD's solver needs one fixed part, so while
it solves SciForge holds each group of jointed parts that nothing grounds by one of its parts
(component 2 of its oldest joint, the part the first joint put the other onto) with a hidden
helper that is pointed at nothing again right after (`joints.free_anchors`,
`_hold_free_groups`). Nothing is grounded in the design, nothing shows in the browser.

### Rigid Group

Pick two or more components, Include Child Components, OK: a Rigid Group step; the components
keep their relative places (as-built) and move as one. Edit Rigid Group (double-click) adds or
removes members. Suppress / Delete free them.

### Joint limits (Edit Joint Limits; also in the Joint dialog's Motion tab)

Minimum, Maximum, Rest, each with a check box and a value (an angle for Revolute, a distance
for Slider, both for Cylindrical). The motion stops at the limits (Drive Joints and Animate
stay inside them); Rest is where the component is put when the dialog closes with OK
**(assumed: Fusion's component returns to its rest after a drag)**; a Rest outside the
limits is refused with a message. A limit switched on starts at the joint's value now, so
switching it on moves nothing; a joint standing outside new limits goes to the nearest one.
Changing only limits never re-places the component (it stays where it was driven).
Fusion also lets you set a limit by dragging in the canvas: the limit being edited takes
the position the joint is dragged to, and flags show where the limits are (source 7, "Flags
show on the canvas").
**(SciForge)** Edit Joint Limits opens the joint's own dialog on its Motion tab (an
as-built joint's one page) instead of Fusion's separate small dialog.

**Dragging to set a limit** (0.1.0-beta.2.2, Luca: "I should be able to drag it where i want
it to max and min. simple as that"). While a joint dialog shows its limits (the Joint
dialog's Motion tab, Edit Joint Limits, As-Built Joint), a handle stands on the joint's
motion: the angle disc round the joint's axis for Revolute and Cylindrical, a blue arrow along
the slide for Slider. Dragging the handle, or the moving part itself, drives the joint live.
Of the two ways the brief offered, SciForge takes the one closest to Fusion: **the row whose
box is the current one follows the drag** (ticking Minimum, Maximum or Rest, or clicking into
its value, makes it the current row); there is no "use position" button. With no current row
the drag only moves the part and stops at the limits. A faint amber ghost of the moving part
(and what hangs on it) stands at Minimum and at Maximum while they are on (SciForge's stand-in
for Fusion's flags). It all happens in the dialog's own undo step: OK is one step, Cancel puts
the part and the limits back. FreeCAD's selection also sees the press on the handle or the part
as a click; the dialog ignores it (it is not a new pick).

### Drive Joints

Pick a joint (browser row, timeline step or a jointed component); a value box (Rotation in
degrees, Distance in mm; Cylindrical has both) with a slider over the joint's range; the
components follow live; Animate plays through the range and back; OK keeps the position (the
POSITION panel then offers Capture Position / Revert), Cancel puts everything back.

### Capture Position / Revert

After components were moved (Drive Joints), Fusion shows a POSITION panel: Capture Position
records the new positions as a step in the timeline ("Position N"); Revert returns the
components to the last captured position (or, without one, to where the joints had put them).
A command that depends on positions (Joint, As-built Joint, Joint Origin, Rigid Group) first
asks: SciForge shows a question "Some components were moved since the last captured position"
with Capture Position (records it, then the command opens), Revert (puts them back, then the
command opens) and Cancel (**SciForge**: Fusion's buttons are Capture Position / Continue,
whose exact meaning forum users found unclear; the meaning is kept, the words are plain). Only
in a design that keeps its history (Capture Design History on); a direct design never asks.
**(SciForge)** the panel cannot appear and disappear in the ribbon yet: both entries live in
the ASSEMBLE menu and are greyed while nothing was moved. An Align of components (MODIFY >
Align, a timeline step) is not a pending move: on OK its components' places become the ones
Capture Position / Revert keep, so the next Joint does not ask and Revert does not take the
Align back (VEX journey, beta 3: G, as Fusion's Align is a timeline step).

### Dragging components (Component Drag; wave 4)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| Press on a component in the canvas and drag: it moves within the freedom its joints leave it | Autodesk (blog 11), Forum (11) | Same (`joints_drag.py`): the drag holds the point that was pressed; a Revolute turns by the angle the pointer goes round its axis (seen edge-on: to the point of the circle under the pointer), a Slider slides to the point of its line nearest the pointer, Cylindrical / Pin-Slot do both, Planar slides in its plane, Ball turns about its centre, all live |
| A component held by nothing moves freely | Forum (11) | It moves in the plane facing you through the pressed point (**Guess**: the plane) |
| Grounded parts stay; parts rigidly held to them stay | Noble (12) | Same; a note says why ("grounded: it does not move"); the drag makes no undo step and draws no box |
| A part chained to the ground through several joints | **Guess** | The first joint with a motion on the way from the pressed part to the ground moves (with everything beyond it); the solver brings the rest of a closed loop along, and the drag stops where the joints cannot follow |
| A group of jointed parts with nothing grounded | **Guess** | Dragging the part the group hangs on (component 2 of its oldest joint) moves the whole group in the view plane; dragging any other part moves it on its joint |
| Joint limits stop a drag | Autodesk (7) | Same (the joint is clamped to its limits) |
| Contact sets stop a drag where parts touch | Autodesk (17) | Same while Enable Contact Sets (or All Contact) is on: the move is cut back to where the parts only touch (bounding boxes, then the solids' distance and common volume, halving the move twelve times) |
| Motion links make the linked joint follow | Autodesk (16) | Same |
| Only components drag; a drag on a body draws a window box | Forum (11) | Components (`App::Part`) always drag; a body at the root drags only when it stands in for a component in the assembly (jointed, grounded, in a rigid group or a contact set) (**SciForge**: SciForge's joints take root bodies as components); a plain body: the window box as before |
| SELECT > Component Drag | Autodesk (11) | A tick in the SELECT menu (on by default, remembered); off, a drag that starts on a component draws a window box. **(SciForge)**: shown in every design; Fusion shows it for direct designs |
| One undo step per drag; the POSITION panel then offers Capture / Revert | Autodesk (6, 13) | Same: one step "Drag <component>"; Esc during the drag puts everything back; Capture Position / Revert get enabled |
| Shift / Ctrl + drag | **Guess** | A selection box (adds / toggles) as before |
| Inside a command | **Guess** | No component drag (a drag there is the command's box) |

### Position modes (Joint, As-built Joint, Joint Origin; wave 4)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| Mode Simple / Between Two Faces / Two Edge Intersection for each joint origin | Autodesk (14) | Same: each component of the Joint dialog has its own Mode (and the As-built Joint's Position and the Joint Origin) |
| Between Two Faces: Plane 1, Plane 2, then a snap point; the origin on the plane halfway between | Autodesk (14, 15) | Same: two flat faces of one body (a curved face is refused: "needs a flat face"); the snap points shown under the mouse are those of the face under the mouse brought onto the halfway plane; Z along plane 1's normal (**Guess**). Faces at an angle: the bisecting plane that has them on opposite sides; faces in one plane are refused |
| Two Edge Intersection: Edge 1 and a non-parallel Edge 2, the origin where they meet when extended | Autodesk (14, 15) | Same: straight edges and arcs (an arc gives its tangent at the end nearer the other edge); parallel edges are refused; skew edges give the middle of their closest points; Z normal to both edges, turned to point out of a face they share; no snap step |
| The origin is previewed | Autodesk (1) | The triad shows where it lands once the mode's picks are made |
| The joint follows later geometry changes | Autodesk (8) | Same: the faces / edges are stored (`SciForgeSnap1/2` "twofaces" / "twoedges" records) and the place is worked out again on today's geometry |

### Hole centres, Ctrl, Duplicate With Joints (beta 3, builder vex)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| No snap at the centre of a square (any non-round) hole | Autodesk; Forum (research/fusion-vex-assembly.md) | **(SciForge)** the centre of every closed inner outline of a flat face is a snap (Joint, Joint Origin, As-built Joint, Duplicate With Joints): lit while the pointer is around the hole, on its edge or in it; a flat wall of a hole gives the hole's ends and middle; the joint keeps the hole after edits (parity/vex-assembly.md, section 1) |
| Ctrl held keeps the face's snaps | Autodesk; Forum | Same in the joint dialogs (Align had it) |
| The dots shown are those of what the click takes | Autodesk (1) | Same: the hover takes what FreeCAD's selection takes (an edge right at the face under the pointer wins, as a click) |
| Duplicate With Joints | Autodesk (22) | Same (ASSEMBLE > Duplicate With Joints; parity/vex-assembly.md, section 3) |

### Motion Link (ASSEMBLE > Motion Link; wave 4)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| Pick two joints | Autodesk (16) | Click their rows in the browser or the timeline, or a jointed component (its first joint with a motion); a click on a picked joint drops it |
| A value per joint: an angle for a turning joint, a distance for a sliding one ("0.394 in" per "360 deg") | Autodesk (16) | Same (Joint 1 360 deg, Joint 2 360 deg or 10 mm to start); a joint with both (Cylindrical, Pin-Slot) gets a Motion choice (Rotate / Slide) (**Guess**) |
| Reverse (shown once the second joint is picked) | Forum (16), API (16) | Same |
| Animate | Autodesk (16) | Plays joint 1 through its range; joint 2 follows |
| When either joint moves (drag, Drive Joints, Animate, a motion study) the other follows | Autodesk (16) | Same, both ways; the joints keep where they stand when the link is made (value 2 = ratio x value 1 + what it was) |
| A step in the timeline and in the Joints folder | Autodesk (16) | Same ("Motion Link 1"); double-click edits it; deleting one of its joints deletes it (same undo step) |
| A pinion turned once moves its rack one circumference | Autodesk (16) | Same; a turning joint counts whole turns (`SciForgeAngle`: a joint driven to 360 reads 360, not 0) |

### Contact Sets (ASSEMBLE; wave 4)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| Disable Contact / Enable Contact Sets / Enable All Contact, one of them on | Autodesk (17) | Three ticked entries of the ASSEMBLE menu, saved with the design (one undo step each); off at first |
| New Contact Set: two or more components | Autodesk (17) | Same; "Contact Set 1" in the browser's Contacts folder (not in the timeline, **Guess**); Edit, Suppress, Rename, Delete from its menu |
| The components of an active set stop where they touch | Autodesk (17) | While dragging and in Drive Joints (it says which parts touch); parts that already overlap when the move starts do not stop it |

### Motion Study (ASSEMBLE > Motion Study; wave 4)

| Fusion | Evidence | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| Pick the joints | Autodesk (18) | Same (rows or jointed components); each gets a point at step 0 where it stands |
| Values at steps 0 to 100 | Autodesk (18) | Joint, Step, Value and Set Point (Delete Point removes the one picked in the list); straight lines between the points (**Guess**: Fusion draws a graph) |
| A playhead to look at any step | Autodesk (18) | A slider 0..100 |
| Play, Speed, Mode Loop | Autodesk (18) | Play / Stop, Speed 0.25x..4x, Mode Play Once / Loop / Ping-Pong (**Guess**: the other mode names) |
| Kept in a Motion Studies folder at the top of the browser | Autodesk (18) | Same (not in the timeline); the parts go back where they were when the dialog closes |

### Nested components (wave 4)

A component inside another component is a part of its own: it can be jointed to its parent or
to anything else and moves on its own (its Placement is written in its parent's frame); a
component without joints moves with its parent. FreeCAD's solver takes every part's
Placement as a place in one frame, so for each solve the nested parts in the assembly hold
their place in design coordinates and get their own back after (`joints._run_solver`).

### Delete, Suppress, Undo, save

Deleting a component deletes its joints (Fusion); deleting a joint leaves the components where
they are. Suppress turns a joint off (the component is free) and Unsuppress puts it back. Every
command is one undo step. Joints, grounds, rigid groups, joint origins and captured positions
are saved with the design and work again after reopening.

SciForge does the deleting inside the delete itself (whoever deletes: the browser, the
timeline, a component's Delete, a script), so **one Ctrl+Z brings the body and its joints
back**: the joints, Pin-Slot helpers and rigid-group links on the part, its ground, a rigid
group left with one member, and the joint origins inside it. Deleting a body that sits
inside a component removes the joints on that body only. Deleting a joint or a rigid group
from the timeline or the browser takes its hidden helpers with it.

A joint keeps its faces when a later step renumbers them (0.1.0-beta.2.2, from Luca's "the
joint gets deleted, the body stays, but cant be edited (tested with fillet)"): a fillet on a
jointed body made FreeCAD number its faces anew, the joint's "Face6" was lost ("?Face6"), the
joint went red and its part could jump. Fusion's joints follow the geometry. SciForge keeps a
small record of each picked face, edge or point (its kind of surface or curve, a point on it,
its normal or axis) next to the snap, and after each recompute (no dialog open) a lost or
changed reference is found again by that record on the same body and renamed
(`joints.repair_references`, logged). Deleting the joint itself never touched the bodies: the
browser (right-click and the Delete key), the timeline and Del in the 3D view all leave both
bodies with their solids, places and Tips (`joints_delete`).

### When the joints fight each other

FreeCAD's solver can report success on an arrangement that breaks a joint (its equations
also accept a half turn, so it may flip a part rather than fail). After every solve SciForge
checks each active joint itself (origins on top of each other, axes the same way, as the
type demands) and treats a broken one as a failure: the dialog says **"The joints cannot all
be satisfied together: <joint> fights the others"**, OK is refused, Cancel puts everything
back. (Fusion shows a similar warning and leaves the joint red.)

## How it is built (FreeCAD 1.1.4's Assembly solver underneath)

| Fusion | SciForge / FreeCAD |
|---|---|
| Joint | an `App::FeaturePython` in the hidden assembly's `Assembly::JointGroup`, proxy `sciforge.joints.JointProxy` (a subclass of FreeCAD's `JointObject.Joint`, so FreeCAD's solver understands it); `SciForgeType` Joint / AsBuiltJoint |
| Rigid, Revolute, Slider, Cylindrical, Ball | FreeCAD's Fixed, Revolute, Slider, Cylindrical, Ball joint types |
| Planar | FreeCAD's Distance joint between two flat faces at distance 0 (the solver's planar constraint: slide in the plane, turn about the normal) |
| Pin-Slot | that planar joint plus a hidden helper joint (Distance 0 between a point and a plane whose normal is the slot's side: the pin stays on the slot's line); the helper follows the joint (`SciForgeParent`) and goes with it |
| Joint origin's place | computed by SciForge from the picked element and snap (`SciForgeSnap1/2`), as `Placement1/2` relative to the component (FreeCAD's convention), so it follows geometry changes; as-built places are stored once |
| Offsets, Angle, Flip | folded into joint origin 1 as stored for the solver (`joints_core.stored_offset`): the solver makes the two stored origins coincide, which is where Fusion puts component 1; SciForge first moves the free component there exactly (`joints.align`, `joints_core.mate_transform`, `keep_heading` so it keeps its heading), then solves. FreeCAD's `preSolve` is not used (it keeps the closest of mated / un-mated, Fusion always mates unless flipped) |
| Solver check | `joints.satisfied` / `broken_joints` after every `solve` (code -2 = "cannot all be satisfied") |
| Limits | FreeCAD's `EnableAngleMin/Max`, `AngleMin/Max`, `EnableLengthMin/Max`, `LengthMin/Max`; the solver only honours them while dragging, so Drive / Animate clamp to them themselves; Rest is SciForge's (`SciForgeRest`) |
| Ground | FreeCAD's `GroundedJoint` (`ObjectToGround`), in the JointGroup, drawn by SciForge (no lock pad in the 3D view; an anchor on the browser row; the row's menu says Ground / Unground) |
| Delete with its part | `joints._DeleteWatch` (a document observer): `remove_joints_of(part)` runs while the part is being deleted, inside the same undo step; never during undo / redo or while a file closes |
| Rigid Group | a `RigidGroup` FeaturePython step (members, Include Child Components) whose hidden helper Fixed joints (as-built placements) sit in the JointGroup |
| Joint Origin | a `PartDesign::CoordinateSystem` datum in the body (or an `App::LocalCoordinateSystem` in a component), `MapMode Deactivated`, placed by SciForge; FreeCAD's joints take an LCS as a reference |
| Capture Position | a `Position` FeaturePython step holding every part's placement; Revert re-applies the newest one (or the positions after the last joint) |
| Drive / Animate | the moving side's placement is set from the joint value (`joints_core.driven_frame`) and the assembly is solved so the rest of the chain follows; a QTimer plays the animation |
| Joints folder, timeline steps | `browser_core` folder "Joints" (kind `joint`, and `motion_link`) and "Joint Origins", "Contacts", "Motion Studies"; `timeline_core` kinds `joint`, `as_built_joint`, `joint_origin`, `rigid_group`, `position`, `motion_link` |
| No ground needed | hidden `AutoGround` GroundedJoint helpers (role `AutoGround`) pointed at the anchor of each free group only inside `joints.solve`, at nothing between solves |
| FreeCAD's own solve on recompute | switched off while SciForge is on (`theme.VIEWER_SETTINGS`: `Mod/Assembly/SolveOnRecompute` False, given back when SciForge is off); SciForge solves after every recompute when a joint is no longer satisfied (`joints_ui.Watch`, `joints.needs_solve`) |
| Component Drag | `selection_ui`'s view filter hands a plain left drag that starts on a draggable component to `joints_drag.start`; `joints.drag_plan` says what moves, `motion_core` turns the pointer's ray into joint values, `joints.place_joint` / `follow_links` / `solve` move the parts |
| Motion Link, Contact Set, Motion Study | FeaturePython steps (`MotionLinkProxy` with `Joint1`, `Joint2`, `SciForgeLink`; `ContactSetProxy` with `Members`; `MotionStudyProxy` with `SciForgeStudy`); the contact mode is `SciForgeContact` on the hidden assembly |

### The component contract (agreed with the Components work)

- A Fusion **component** is an `App::Part` at the document root (nested components are
  nested `App::Part`s); its bodies are `PartDesign::Body` objects inside it. The **root
  component is the document itself**: bodies with no component sit at the document root.
- Joints work on **parts**: the nearest component of what was clicked (an `App::Part`,
  nested ones too since wave 4), else a root `PartDesign::Body` (a `Part::Feature` solid at
  the root, e.g. an imported part, counts too). A body inside a component moves with its
  component; a nested component is a part of its own (Fusion), and moves with its parent
  only when no joint moves it (see "Nested components").
- The solver needs one `Assembly::AssemblyObject`. SciForge makes **one hidden root
  assembly** (`SciForgeAssembly`, Label "Assembly", `Placement` identity, never shown in the
  browser or the timeline) on the first joint, ground or rigid group. It **owns only the
  joints** (its `Joints` group); bodies and components stay where they are in the document
  (FreeCAD's solver reads a part's `Placement` from the joint references, not from the
  assembly's group: checked in the probes `scratchpad/joints/probe1-3.py`). So a design with
  two plain bodies and no component is jointed by `J`, pick, pick, OK; a design with
  components joints the components by the same code path. The Components work must not move
  bodies into the assembly object nor make a second `Assembly::AssemblyObject`.
- Motion is a change of the part's `Placement` (the body's or the component's), never of the
  solids inside: later modelling steps keep working, and a `Move/Copy` step inside a body
  composes with it.
- A joint reference is `[part, ["<body>.<element>", ...]]`: the part the solver moves, then
  the path to the body (or joint-origin datum) holding the element. Bodies inside one
  component are one part: a joint between two of them is refused ("Both picks are on
  Component1").
- **Bodies moving between components** (the components work's Create Components from Bodies,
  Move to Component, a drag in the browser): `joints.reroot` (run by the same observer on
  every component's `Group` change, inside the same undo step) points the joints, the grounds
  and the rigid groups at the part that now holds the body; a joint whose two sides end up in
  one component is switched off (Suppressed) with a warning. Tested headless with components
  made the way `components.py` makes them, and in `joints_components`.
- **Extrude > New Body from another body's sketch** (how the test designs are made): the
  hidden profile binder (`extrude._binder`) no longer follows the sketch's *global* place
  (FreeCAD's relative binding moved the new body's own geometry each time a joint moved one
  of the two bodies): it copies the profile in the sketch body's frame, frozen where that
  body stood when the extrude was made (`SciForgeFrame` on the binder).

Merge notes for the Components work (both branches touch `browser_core.py`,
`browser_ui.py`, `timeline_core.py`, `ribbon_config.py`, `config.py`, `bodies_gui.py`,
`extrude.py`):

- Add **Ground** to the component row's menu (`MENUS["component"]`, handled like the body
  row's: `_joint_action("toggle_ground", obj)`, text Unground when `node["grounded"]`) and
  set `"grounded"` on component rows (`_grounded_names` already collects component names).
- `components.place()` / `from_bodies()` move bodies without keeping their global place. A
  joint moves a whole component, so its `Placement` stops being identity: a body dragged into
  or out of a moved component then jumps. Fusion keeps the body where it is; the fix belongs
  in `components.place()` (`body.Placement = new_container_global⁻¹ * old_global`).
- With the components work's "allow duplicate labels" on, FreeCAD stops renaming a new
  "Rigid 1" to "Rigid 002" after an undo left the old label registered (seen once in
  `joints_asbuilt_group`, cosmetic).

## Known gaps (never faked: listed here)

| Fusion | Why not (yet) |
|---|---|
| Between Two Faces with faces of two bodies of one component | the two faces (and the snap) must be on one body |
| A drag through several joints at once (Fusion's solver drags the whole mechanism toward the pointer) | the first joint with a motion on the way to the ground moves; the rest of a closed loop follows the solver |
| Contact in Animate Joint and in a motion study | contact stops drags and Drive Joints only |
| Limit flags (Fusion's own flag look) | a faint ghost of the part at Minimum and Maximum; the Rest has no ghost |
| Cylindrical: drag its slide limits | the handle and the part drag set the angle; the slide limits are typed |
| Pin-Slot and Ball limits; Planar (no limits in Fusion either) | FreeCAD limits exist for Revolute, Slider and Cylindrical only |
| Ball: Pitch / Yaw axis choices, Pin-Slot custom axes | a Ball turns about its origin whatever the axes; Pin-Slot takes Slide X or Y of the joint origin |
| The POSITION toolbar panel that appears after a move | Capture Position / Revert are menu entries, greyed while nothing moved |
| Lock Motion, Animate Joint Relationships | not built |
| Motion Study's graph (values drawn over the steps, points dragged on it) | the points are typed (Joint, Step, Value) and listed |
| Motion Link with more than two joints, links to a Motion Study's own drivers | two joints per link (Fusion's too); links chain |
| Joint names "Rigid1", "Rev1"... | SciForge names them "Rigid 1", "Revolute 1", ... **(assumed)** |
| Joint origins listed inside the component | the browser has a document-level "Joint Origins" folder (bodies have no child rows yet) |
| Files opened in plain FreeCAD | the joints' proxy classes are SciForge's: plain FreeCAD shows the parts where they are and warns about the missing module |
| Edit Joint Limits as its own small dialog | the joint's dialog opens on its Motion tab |
| Drive Joints / Animate Joint greyed for a Rigid joint in the menu | the entries are there and say "rigid: it has no motion" |
| A joint in error stays (red) when its geometry goes | SciForge deletes the joint with the body or component it was on (one undo step) |
| Two joints fighting: Fusion leaves the newest red but keeps it | SciForge refuses OK until it is changed or cancelled |

## Tests (real FreeCAD 1.1.4, real clicks: `tools/sciforge/run_tests.sh --scenario ...`)

| Scenario | Paths (checks) |
|---|---|
| `joints_basic` | J, hover snaps, two picks, Revolute, OK, undo / redo; edit from the timeline (Angle, Offset Z, Flip, one-step undo); timeline Delete; same component twice refused; corner snap; Cancel; Esc; J with one body (85) |
| `joints_types` | every type on two boxes: Rigid, Slider (axis X, limits), Cylindrical, Pin-Slot, Planar, Ball, Revolute (limits, a refused Rest, Rest 10 on OK); the Animate button's motion is watched sample by sample (what turns, what slides, inside the limits); OK; one-step undo with the ground and the Pin-Slot helper (229) |
| `joints_asbuilt_group` | Ground / Unground from the browser with undo / redo; Joint Origin (hover, corner, Offset Z) picked by J from its browser row; As-Built Revolute (nothing moves, the axis where picked); Animate Joint + Esc; Edit Joint Limits; Rigid Group (the pin follows a drive, clamped at the limit); suppress / unsuppress the group; a joint the solver cannot satisfy (message, OK refused, Cancel); deleting a body takes its group and joint origin in one undo step (133) |
| `joints_drive` | Drive Joints (box, slider PageUp), undo / redo; Capture Position, drive, Revert Position; Edit Joint Limits (limit starts at the value, then clamps); Drive clamped at the limit, Cancel; Animate Joint + Esc; Suppress / Unsuppress from the timeline; save, close, reopen, drive again; deleting the jointed body, one undo step (107) |
| `joints_components` | a body inside an `App::Part` component (made like `components.from_bodies`): J picks through the component, the component moves (the body keeps its placement); Drive; the body leaves the component (the joint follows it), undo; the component deleted with its joint in one step, undo (46) |
| `joints2_drag` | a Revolute dragged +90 in the top view (angle measured), one undo step, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y; Esc during a drag; the free pair dragged by its anchor (both move); the plate grounded: no move, a note, the block still turns; Capture Position prompt (Capture, then Revert); SELECT > Component Drag off draws a box; save / reopen / drag (78) |
| `joints2_slider` | a Slider dragged to its limit; New Contact Set (Contacts folder); contact off: through the wall; Enable Contact Sets: the drag stops where the block touches the wall; Drive Joints stops there too and says so; a free component dragged on the view plane; Disable Contact (75) |
| `joints2_modes` | Joint Origin Between Two Faces (a rounded face refused, top and bottom faces, the hover's snaps on the halfway plane, origin at z = 5); J with component 2 on Two Edge Intersection (the corner a fillet took away); edit from the timeline (mode and edges shown, Offset Z, undo / redo); parallel edges refused; save / reopen (70) |
| `joints2_motion` | a pinion (Revolute) and its rack (Slider) tied by a Motion Link (360 deg : 2 pi r); one turn slides the rack 2 pi r and reads 360; a canvas drag carries the rack; Reverse; the Slider drives the pinion back; Motion Study (point at step 100, playhead, Play Once to one turn, Motion Studies folder); save / reopen (99) |
| `joints2_nested` | a component nested in another (New Component, Parent): jointed, it moves on its own (its parent stays), turns when dragged, comes along when its parent is dragged; Drive Joints (55) |
| `joints_delete` | a filleted block, Revolute at 90; the joint deleted from the browser row: both bodies keep solid, volume, place and Tip, nothing in error; the fillet still edits (r 3, undo); Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y; the same from the timeline; a fillet after the joint (the joint finds its face again, the block stays); Delete key on the row, Del in the 3D view (143) |
| `joints_limits_drag` | Edit Joint Limits: the angle handle on the axis; tick Maximum, drag the disc to 90 (the block turns, Maximum follows, a ghost); tick Minimum, drag to -45 (two ghosts); OK keeps both, no ghost left, Ctrl+Z; again: drag the block itself to 60 (Maximum and the handle follow, not a new pick), Cancel puts it all back (48) |
