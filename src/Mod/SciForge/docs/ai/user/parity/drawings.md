# Parity spec: Drawings (outline 7.16)

Fusion's DRAWING workspace: a 2D drawing made from a design, with views placed by clicks,
section and detail views, centre marks, dimensions, notes, a title block filled from the
design, a parts list with balloons for assemblies, and PDF / DXF export; the drawing
follows the design when the design changes. SciForge builds it on FreeCAD's TechDraw
(`DrawPage`, `DrawSVGTemplate`, `DrawViewPart`, `DrawViewSection`, `DrawViewDetail`,
`DrawBrokenView`, `DrawViewDimension`, `DrawViewBalloon`, `DrawViewAnnotation`,
`DrawViewSymbol`, cosmetic lines and centre lines) with its own Fusion-style commands.

Implemented in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`: `drawing_core.py` (no FreeCAD, no Qt: sheets,
scales, the title block template, projection and section maths, section types, dimension
inference, parts-list rows and table, hatch lines, a DXF writer; unit tests
`SciForgeTests/unit/test_drawing_core.py`), `drawing_fits.py` (ISO 286 limits and fits;
`test_drawing_fits.py`), `drawing_dims_core.py` (a dimension's text: override, text
before / after, precision, tolerances, fits, basic, reference; `test_drawing_dims_core.py`),
`drawing_annot_core.py` (leaders, feature control frames, datum identifiers, surface
texture, ordinates, arc lengths as shapes, their SVG and DXF; `test_drawing_annot_core.py`),
`drawing_pdf.py` (one PDF from the sheets' PDFs; tested there too), `drawing_pdf_core.py`, `drawing_pdf_objects.py`, `drawing_pdf_font.py` (no FreeCAD, no Qt: the PDF rewritten with layers, searchable text, links and metadata, a small PDF reader / writer, osifont embedded as a subset; `test_drawing_pdf_core.py`), `drawing_pdf_export.py` (Export PDF: markers in TechDraw's scene, the texts and metadata from the drawing), `drawing.py` (the
TechDraw objects, no GUI), `drawing_annot.py` (dimension settings and annotations that
follow their edges), `drawing_sheets.py` (several sheets per drawing, export of all
sheets), `drawing_depth.py` (Section Depth, and no seam line across a cut hole: the
section's lines that lie deeper, or only on a hole's seam, switched off),
`drawing_breakout.py` (Breakout Section View: the trimmed copy a view draws, its floor's
hatching), `drawing_breakout_ui.py` (its command and dialog), `drawing_ui.py` (the drawing's tab, the mouse on the sheet, the view dialogs and
22 commands), `drawing_annot_ui.py` (the Dimension dialog and 10 commands: Ordinate,
Baseline, Chain, Arc Length, Edit Dimension, Leader, Feature Control Frame, Datum
Identifier, Surface Texture, Edge Extension), `drawing_sheets_ui.py` (the sheet bar; New
Sheet, Delete Sheet), the contextual DRAWING tab in `ribbon_config.py` / `ribbon_ui.py`,
the Drawings folder of the browser (`browser_core.py`, `browser_ui.py`), icons `dw_*`
(`tools/sciforge/make_icons.py`). No FreeCAD core change.
Status: **built and tested with real clicks in the real FreeCAD 1.1.4; not yet checked by
Luca against Fusion.**

## What the user does (and what SciForge does)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| File > New Drawing > From Design; Workspace > Drawing > From Design | Same: the application menu's **New Drawing**, and the workspace button **DESIGN > Drawing > From Design...** (that menu also lists the design's drawings). An empty design is refused: "There is nothing to draw yet: the design has no solid bodies..." |
| Create Drawing: Contents, Template, Standard, Units, Sheet Size, Automatic / Manual | Same: Contents Full Assembly / Visible Only / Select (Select shows the bodies, "Component / Body", to tick); Template *SciForge title block* or *Blank sheet (frame only)*; Standard ISO / ASME (ISO for an mm design, ASME for an inch one); Units mm / in; Sheet Size ISO A4..A0 (A3) or ASME A..E (B); Views Manual or Automatic (base view, two projected views and an isometric one at an automatic scale, one undo step) |
| The drawing opens in its own tab | Same: a tab "<design> Drawing" ("... Drawing 2" for the next). While it is the active tab the ribbon shows only the **DRAWING** tab, the workspace button says DRAWING, the timeline and the navigation bar step aside; another tab brings the design's ribbon back |
| Base View: the view follows the mouse, a click places it; Orientation, Style, Scale, Tangent Edges; OK | Same: Orientation Front / Back / Top / Bottom / Left / Right / Home; the four styles (Shaded is drawn as faces filled with one light colour, see gaps); Scale from the list (50:1 .. 1:200) or typed (1:2.5, 1/4, 0.5); Tangent Edges Full Length / Off. The changes show live; Esc / Cancel leaves nothing. The title block's Scale follows the base view |
| Projected View | Same: the only base view is the parent (else click one); moving round it shows the view that will be made (first angle: the view from above goes below; third angle: above), the four corners give isometric views; a click places each; back over the parent the preview goes; Enter / Esc ends; the projected views are one undo step. They take the parent's style and scale, and stay lined up when the parent is dragged or turned |
| Double-click a view | Its dialog: Base View (orientation, style, scale, tangent edges; the projected views turn with it), Section, Detail, or Edit View (style; a broken view's gap). Cancel puts everything back. Views are moved by dragging their frame |
| Section View | Click the view, then the cut line's points (each within 3 degrees of horizontal or vertical is straightened); more than two bend the line; Enter (or a click on the last point again) ends it, and so does moving well away from the view (more than 12 mm past it); move to the side to look from and click to place: **SECTION A-A** under the view, the cut line with arrows and letters on the parent, the cut faces hatched at 45 degrees, lined up with the parent. The dialog shows the Type found from the line (Full; Half: two segments at a right angle; Offset: jogged; Aligned: another angle; TechDraw's complex section cuts along the bent line) and has Label (B-B...), Scale, Style (hidden edges), Section Depth (Full / Slice / Distance with its mm), Hatch on / off, Show the view label, Center marks. Letters skip I, O, Q, S, X, Z. Depth on a bent line is refused ("works with a straight cut line"). Slice and Distance switch off the section's lines that lie deeper (the cut faces stay TechDraw's own); a hole cut in half shows no line along its middle |
| Breakout Section View | CREATE > Breakout Section View: click a base or projected view (an isometric one, a section, a detail or a view with a breakout already is refused with a message); the Depth box offers half the parts' depth; click the corners of a boundary around what should show (a preview follows the mouse) and the first corner again (or Enter): the cut is made, what lies inside shows in the view, the floor of the cut is hatched; type another depth (or press Default) and see it change; OK (one undo step), Esc / Cancel leaves nothing. The view's dimensions and annotations stay; an isometric view projected from it shows the cut too, other projected views the whole parts. Double-click inside the boundary later: Edit Breakout (depth, **Remove Breakout**). It follows the design and is saved with it |
| Detail View | Click the view, the centre (it snaps to a fillet's or hole's centre), the circle's size, then place the view: **DETAIL A (2:1)** at twice the parent's scale, a circle and letter on the parent. Label and Scale in the dialog |
| Break View | Click the view, then the two ends of the part to leave out: the broken view stands in for the view (the original is hidden), the break follows the direction of the two clicks; Gap (10 mm) in the dialog and in Edit View. Selecting the broken view and Del brings the original view back |
| Center Mark, Centerline | Center Mark: click circles or arcs; two dash-dot lines cross at the centre, 3 mm past the circle; a hole that has one is said; a straight edge is refused ("click a circle"); Enter / Esc ends. Centerline: click two parallel edges: a dash-dot line midway. Centre marks follow their hole when the design changes, and go when the hole goes |
| Dimension (D) | Same rules: a straight edge gives its length (horizontal, vertical, or aligned when slanted), a circle its diameter (with the diameter sign), an arc its radius (R), two parallel edges their distance, two edges at an angle the angle, points or circle centres the distance between them (horizontal / vertical / aligned from where the mouse is). The dimension follows the mouse until a click places it; each placed dimension is one undo step; the command stays for the next one; Esc drops an unplaced one, Esc again ends. Linear, Aligned, Angular, Radius and Diameter Dimension force their kind. An isometric view is refused ("An isometric view cannot be dimensioned: its lengths are drawn shorter...") |
| Text | Click two corners or drag the box open, type in the dialog's box (Enter makes a new line), OK: the note in the box's middle, 3.5 mm text |
| Double-click a dimension: the Dimension dialog | Measured value; Text before, Override value, Text after, with symbol buttons (diameter, R, square, degree, plus/minus, arc, depth, counterbore, countersink) typing into the field used last; Precision (Default, 0 ... 0.1234); Tolerance None / Symmetric / Deviation / Limits / Fit with Upper and Lower; for Fit: Basis (Hole / Shaft), Fit type, Fit (the ISO preferred fits of that basis and type, or Custom with typed hole and shaft classes), "This dimension is the" Hole / Shaft, Display (Class: "10 H7"; Class and tolerances: +0.015 over 0 beside it; Limits: 10.015 over 10.000; Fit: "10 H7/g6") and the fit's limits and clearance written in the dialog; Tolerance precision; Basic (boxed, no tolerance); Reference (in parentheses). Live on the sheet; a wrong entry (an upper below the lower, a class SciForge does not know, a size over 500 mm for a fit) is said in the dialog and OK waits; Cancel / Esc puts it back; one undo step. Also DIMENSIONS > Edit Dimension on a selected dimension |
| Ordinate Dimension | Click the origin (a corner, an edge's end or a circle's centre), then a point, then where its value goes: up or down measures across (x, the value along the leader in ISO, level in ASME), sideways measures up (y); the origin gets its 0 on that axis; the next values snap onto the first one's line when near it; each placing is one undo step; Esc drops a picked point, Esc again ends. The values follow the design |
| Baseline / Chain Dimension | Click an existing horizontal or vertical dimension near the end to start from, then more points (corners, circle centres, edge ends): Baseline makes each from that end, stacked 8 mm further out; Chain each from the point before, on the first one's line. Real TechDraw dimensions (they follow the design and take the Dimension dialog) |
| Arc Length Dimension | Click an arc, then the place: extension lines, a dimension arc with arrows and the length with the arc sign; a whole circle is refused (it takes a diameter) |
| Leader | Click an edge (the arrow goes on it), then where the text goes (a landing towards it), type the text; double-click edits it; drag its text to move it (the arrow stays) |
| Feature Control Frame | Characteristic (the 14 of ISO 1101), tolerance with a round zone and a material condition (M / L), primary / secondary / tertiary datums with modifiers, Composite (a second row sharing the symbol cell); click an edge for the leader, or empty paper for a frame alone, then the place; double-click edits it. The symbols are drawn from lines and circles (no font needed) |
| Datum Identifier | The next free letter by default (A, B...); click the edge (a filled triangle stands on it), then where the box goes |
| Surface Texture | Symbol (basic, material removal required, prohibited), roughness ("Ra 3.2"), lay, All around; click the edge, then the place: on the edge (a click next to where it was picked) or away with a leader; ISO writes the value under the long leg's line, ASME above |
| Edge Extension | GEOMETRY > Edge Extension: click two straight edges; thin lines run from their ends to where they meet and a point there takes dimensions (a rounded corner's sharp corner); it follows the edges when the design changes |
| Drawing View dialog extras | Every view's dialog (base, projected, section, detail, broken) has Center marks: Holes, Round Extrudes, Round Cuts (centre marks where those rounds are seen end on, centre lines where seen from the side, 3 mm past them, following the design) and the view label (base and projected views: its text and Show; section and detail views: Show). Section and detail dialogs have Style, so hidden edges can be shown per view |
| Several sheets | Every drawing's tab has a sheet bar along its bottom: one tab per sheet and a +. + adds an empty sheet (same size, standard and title block) and shows it; clicking a tab shows that sheet in the drawing's one tab; right-click a tab: New Sheet (after it), Rename Sheet (its name becomes a box: Enter keeps, Esc not; also by double-click), Delete Sheet (the sheet and everything on it; the last sheet cannot go: "delete the whole drawing in the browser instead"), Move Left / Right; dragging a tab moves the sheet. Each is one undo step. The title blocks number the sheets "2 / 3" in the bar's order; fields typed into a title block show on every sheet; each sheet's scale is its own. Deleting the first sheet keeps the drawing (its name passes to the next sheet). The browser lists the drawing once; deleting it there deletes all its sheets |
| Title block | Filled from the design: Title and Part Number (the design's name), Material (the bodies' material), Drawn by (the user), Date, Scale, Size, Sheet (1 / 1, its place among the drawing's sheets), Units, the standard and its projection symbol. Double-click the title block (or MODIFY > Title Block): its fields to type in, live on the sheet; a typed field keeps its text, the others keep following the design (a renamed design renames the title); Cancel puts the old text back |
| Table (parts list) and balloons | TABLES > Table: the table follows the mouse (an outline), a click places its top left corner; rows Item, Qty, Part Number (the component's name), Description, Material, one row per component (same names counted in Qty; an occurrence of a component, "Screw:2", counts as its original: beta 3, vex); in the lower half of the sheet the header is at the bottom; a balloon per row is put on the view, outside it, pointing at an edge of that component. A second Table is refused ("This drawing already has a parts list."). The rows follow renamed components, and in a Full Assembly drawing a component added to the design later comes into the views and the parts list (its balloon is added with Balloon) |
| Balloon | Click an edge of a component on a view, then where the balloon goes: its number is the component's item; the next component, Enter / Esc ends; all balloons of one command are one undo step. Without a parts list it is refused ("make the parts list first (TABLES > Table)"); a click on empty paper says to click a component's edge |
| Delete | Select views, dimensions, notes, balloons or the parts list on the sheet and press Del (or MODIFY > Delete): a view takes its dimensions, balloons, sections, details and projected views with it, one undo step |
| Export PDF | EXPORT > Export PDF: Name (the drawing's), Sheets (All Sheets / Current Sheet), Location (the design's folder, or Documents), *Open the PDF afterwards* (ticked); Export writes the sheets as one vector PDF, each page its sheet's size (white paper, hatching, text), and opens it. An empty name or no folder is said in the dialog, which stays. The PDF has **layers** the viewer's layer panel switches on and off: Visible Edges, Hidden Edges, Centerlines and Center Marks, Hatching and Section Lines (also the section and break lines, detail circles), Dimensions and Annotations (also captions, notes, balloons, symbols, the parts list), Border and Title Block; all of its **text can be searched and copied** (dimensions, notes, captions as TechDraw prints them; the title block, SciForge's leaders / symbols and the parts list, which TechDraw prints as outlines, get invisible text over them in osifont, embedded as a subset; a character osifont lacks, such as ′ ″ or Chinese, is kept as the text's ActualText, and a feature control frame's drawn symbol and diameter sign read as ⌖ ⌀); a URL (https://..., www....) or mailto: in a note, leader or title block field is a **clickable link**; the **document properties** are the title block's: Title, Author (Drawn By), Subject (Part Number - Description), Keywords (part number, material, scale, size), Creator SciForge. With every layer on the page looks exactly as TechDraw printed it |
| Export DXF | EXPORT > Export DXF: the same dialog (*Open afterwards* not ticked); All Sheets writes one DXF per sheet named after it ("name - Sheet 1.dxf"). The DXF (R12, the sheet in millimetres, dimension values as written on the sheet, tolerances on one line) has layers SHEET (frame, title block), VISIBLE, HIDDEN, CENTER (centre marks, automated ones, centre lines, section lines with their bends), HATCH, DIMENSIONS (lines, arrows, values as on the sheet, ordinates, arc lengths), TEXT (notes, captions, balloons, leaders), SYMBOLS (feature control frames, datums, surface texture) and TABLE (the parts list) |
| The drawing follows the design | Immediately: the views, dimensions (their values), centre marks, title block and parts list update when the design changes (an edit in the timeline, Undo in the design), also after the design was saved and opened again |
| Undo / redo | Every command is one undo step on the design's undo list (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y on the sheet or the quick-access buttons) |
| Drawings are files of their own | Drawings are saved inside the design's file and listed in the browser's **Drawings** folder: double-click (or right-click > Open Drawing) opens one, Rename, Delete (one undo step; its tab closes). Opening a drawing does not mark the design as changed |

## Known gaps (never faked)

| Fusion | Why not (yet) |
|---|---|
| A drawing is a separate document (.f2d) linked to a design version, with an out-of-date badge and Update | SciForge keeps drawings inside the design's file (FreeCAD's TechDraw pages live in the document of the parts they show), so a drawing is always up to date. There is no separate drawing file to share; export PDF / DXF for that |
| The Sheet Bar's thumbnails, Destination "an existing drawing", sheets of different sizes | The sheet bar shows names, not pictures; a new sheet takes the active sheet's size and title block (change of size per sheet not built); a new drawing is always a new drawing |
| Templates (Browse, Template contextual environment, custom title blocks, Add Title Block) | Only SciForge's own title block or a blank frame; editing the template's layout is not built |
| Shaded and Shaded with Hidden Edges styles | TechDraw cannot render shading: the faces are filled with one light colour |
| Tangent Edges "Shortened" | TechDraw shows tangent edges full length or not at all |
| Exploded View | Exploded views come from Fusion's animation storyboards, which SciForge does not have |
| Breakout: a sketched spline profile picked in the dialog; components left out of the cut; "move the start point to the front" | The boundary is a polygon of clicked points (no spline), where it cuts material TechDraw draws ordinary lines (Fusion: a thin break line); every part is cut; the depth is measured from the front of the parts when the breakout is made and again after every change (so the start-point button is not needed). A section or detail view made from a view with a breakout shows the breakout too (TechDraw cuts and enlarges what the parent view draws); a break view of a view with a breakout shows the whole parts |
| Section Depth on a bent cut line; a bend's seam line; Distance cutting a line in two | Depth works on straight lines only (refused with a message on bent ones), and so does the hiding of a cut hole's seam line; TechDraw's complex section draws a thin line where the offset line jogs (Fusion draws none). TechDraw can only switch a whole line off: a line that is partly within the Distance shows whole. After a design change a big section's deeper lines are switched off once TechDraw has drawn it (SciForge looks again 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 s later) |
| Detail boundary options (jagged / smooth, full boundary, connection line) | TechDraw draws a circle on the parent and the detail without a boundary |
| Break line styles; several breaks in one view; a break of a section view | One break per broken view, TechDraw's break lines |
| Center Mark Pattern; telling a Hole feature from a Round Cut | Not built (greyed); Holes and Round Cuts both mark every inner round (SciForge cannot tell which feature made a cylinder) |
| Arranging dimensions (Arrange, spacing); Hole and Thread notes | Not built; Baseline stacks 8 mm apart |
| Feature control frames and surface texture attached to a dimension; frames without a leader dragged under a dimension stay "associated" | They attach to edges (or stand alone on the paper) |
| Note (TEXT group), Weld symbol | Not built (greyed); Weld was optional in the brief |
| Leader with several segments; text styles (fonts, bold, lists, justification) in notes | One straight leader line with a landing; plain text |
| Tolerance on angles shown stacked | Angles take Symmetric / Deviation / Limits; Fit is refused for angles (there is no ISO fit for an angle) |
| Ordinate dimensions with separate X and Y origins, jogged ordinate leaders, an origin on an edge's middle | One origin point per set; straight leaders |
| Renumber and Align Balloons; patent balloons; sub-assembly structure in the parts list; column choice and order | Not built: the parts list lists the components the view shows, first level only, with fixed columns |
| Export DWG; Export CSV of the parts list; uniform line weights in the PDF | No DWG writer in FreeCAD's Python API; CSV not built |
| PDF layers in a PDF/A file; layers for a view that is off the sheet | FreeCAD's PDF preferences can make Qt write PDF/A-1b, which forbids layers: such a file gets no layers, but the markers are still taken out (Qt paints them opaque there); the added text's osifont subset has a CIDSet, the XMP keeps Qt's PDF/A and xmpMM entries and says pdf:Trapped like the document information (links and metadata still), so the file stays PDF/A as far as SciForge's additions go (not checked with veraPDF, not available here). PDF/X-4 (the same preference) keeps its PDF/X version, document ids and pdf:Trapped, and gets layers (X-4 allows them) but no link annotations (a print-ready page has none). Without an embeddable font no text is added to either. Qt does not print what is off the sheet, so a view that lies wholly outside it has nothing to sort |
| PDF: the title block's searchable text exactly over the drawn letters | The title block is an SVG that Qt prints as outlines; the searchable text is invisible text placed at the same point, stretched to the width Qt measures for the font the SVG asks for: selecting it highlights roughly, not glyph by glyph, where the letters are |
| PDF: centre lines told from hidden edges by their meaning | In a view TechDraw draws every edge at one stacking level; SciForge sorts them by how they are drawn: solid is visible, dashed at the view's hidden line width is hidden, any other dash (SciForge's centre marks are dashed at 0.18 mm, centre lines dash-dot) is a centre line. An edge a person formats as dashed at the hidden width counts as hidden |
| PDF: each sheet its own size | Every page keeps its sheet's size (tested with an A3 and an A4 sheet made by script), but SciForge cannot yet make sheets of different sizes (see above) |
| Rotate a view; Move with snapping | Views move by dragging their frame (TechDraw), no rotation command |
| Title block attributes Mass, Project Folder, custom attributes | Not filled: the title block has fixed fields |

## FreeCAD / TechDraw facts this relies on

- **A Python event filter on a TechDraw view must go before the view is deleted** (crash
  found by Luca, 2026-10-16: closing a drawing closed the whole program). Closing a
  drawing's tab deletes `MDIViewPage` and its `QGVPage`; `~QWidget` sends one last event
  through the widget's own event filters, and PySide wrapping the half-deleted widget for
  SciForge's `PageInput.eventFilter` segfaults (`QObject::property` in
  `PySide::getWrapperForQObject`). Nothing in the Python filter can guard it: it never
  runs. `PageInput` now watches the tab's `QMdiSubWindow` for its Close event (x, Window >
  Close) and a Gui document observer for `slotDeletedDocument` (closing the design deletes
  its tabs without a Close event), and takes its filters off first. Scenario
  `drawing_close` (x with the Base View dialog open, x after a view, Window > Close, the
  design closed with the drawing current).

Part 2 (2026-10-14):

- `DrawView.findParentPage()` crashes FreeCAD (a segfault in TechDraw) for a view that
  is on no page yet: `drawing.page_of` uses the InList only.
- `DrawViewDimension.getLinearPoints()` returns its points scaled, from the view's
  centre, with y down (the DXF's dimension lines were mirrored before).
- A dimension's tolerance texts show only with `EqualTolerance = False`; with
  `ArbitraryTolerances` the two `FormatSpecOver/UnderTolerance` strings are written as
  they are, stacked beside the value at `TolSizeAdjust` (TechDraw/Dimensions, 0.5 by
  default; SciForge sets 0.7 while it is on). A two-line `FormatSpec` (Arbitrary) shows
  limits stacked; `TheoreticalExact` draws the basic box.
- TechDraw files a "Drag Dimension" undo step whenever a selected dimension's value is
  laid out again (its text changed size) and then deselected: the Dimension dialog
  clears the selection before its own step, so one Undo takes back the dialog.
- A task panel's attribute must not shadow `taskui.Panel` methods (`feature`, `finish`,
  `schedule`...): an attribute `feature = None` made OK fail with "NoneType is not
  callable" and left the panel's mouse handler alive.
- `getGeometricCenter()` measures the parts with the 3D view's mesh; TechDraw centres a
  view on the exact bounding box (a copy without mesh): 0.02 mm apart on an R8 fillet.
  `drawing.centre_of` computes TechDraw's centre.
- `makeCosmeticVertex` takes y-up points (it inverts them itself); `makeCosmeticLine`
  too; `formatGeometricEdge(index, style, weight, colour, visible)` hides one edge by
  index (the sheet and the PDF respect it; `clearGeomFormats()` undoes all).
- `DrawViewSection` cuts its parent view's shape (`getShapeToCut` uses the BaseView's
  `getSourceShape()`), never its own `Source`: a section's depth cannot be given by a
  trimmed copy as its Source; SciForge switches the deeper lines off instead, matching
  them by geometry (`getEdgeByIndex(i)`: unscaled, from the section's middle, the same
  way up as `getVisibleEdges(True)`) against `TechDraw.projectEx` of the trimmed parts,
  centred where TechDraw centres a section (the box of the cut pieces in the view's
  axes), and again whenever the section's lines or the parts change.
- A boolean leaves the straight seam (or the join of two halves) of a hole's round face
  as an ordinary edge, which TechDraw's section draws as a hard line across the cut hole;
  such a line, covered by no other edge, is switched off the same way.
- `DrawViewPart.execute()` does nothing while the view's previous hidden-line removal
  still runs: a trimmed copy changed right after a recompute was missed by its view. The
  breakout's copy is a `Part::FeaturePython` linking the parts, so it is remade in the
  recompute before its view (its proxy class is found again when the file is opened).
- `TechDraw::DrawComplexSection` cuts along a sketch (CuttingToolWireObject) that lies
  square to the parent view's direction; `ProjectionStrategy` Offset for jogged / half
  sections, Aligned for angled ones; SectionNormal from the first segment.
- An SVG `DrawViewSymbol` is placed by its middle (X, Y), at its size in mm with
  ScaleType Custom and Scale 1; its texts and shapes go into the PDF as vectors.
- One PDF per page from `TechDrawGui.exportPageAsPdf`; TechDraw's "print all" writes
  every page of the document (all drawings), so SciForge merges the sheets' PDFs itself
  (`drawing_pdf.py`: Qt's PDFs have a plain cross-reference table).
- What Qt's PDF from TechDraw holds (FreeCAD 1.1.4, Qt 6.8.3, looked at 2026-10-22):
  vector paths in one Flate content stream per page, PDF 1.4, a plain cross-reference
  table; text TechDraw draws as text (dimensions, notes, captions, balloons, section
  letters) is real text in subset TrueType fonts with ToUnicode maps (searchable), but
  everything from an SVG (the template's title block and zone letters, `DrawViewSymbol`s:
  SciForge's annotations and parts list) is outlines; no layers, no links; Title is the
  page's internal name ("Drawing001"), Creator "FreeCAD 1.1.4 TechDraw", Producer Qt, no
  author or subject. Qt also writes closepaths without a current point and colour
  operators without values, which viewers report as syntax errors (SciForge's rewrite
  leaves them out: they draw nothing).
- Layers come from markers: Qt items SciForge puts into TechDraw's scene as children of
  each view item for the print, stacked by z-value between the kinds of things TechDraw
  draws in a view (`ZVALUE.h`: faces / hatching 10-41, edges 70 (hidden ones too: their
  60 is overwritten), centre marks 80, section / break lines 90, caption 0). TechDraw
  rebuilds a view's edges when it prints (`refreshViews`) but removes only its own
  primitives, so the markers stay. A marker under the template item crashed FreeCAD in
  the print (`ViewProviderTemplate::setMarkers`): none go there; what is printed before
  the first marker is the template. A marker's `type()` must not be Qt's default
  `UserType` (TechDraw's `QGCustomBorder`). A marker outside what a view covers makes the
  view's extent bigger and TechDraw put the view's caption under it: markers sit at the
  view's middle (its origin). Fully transparent painting is skipped by Qt's PDF writer:
  markers are painted with alpha 1/255 and taken out of the PDF.
- `TechDrawGui.getSceneForPage(page)` gives a page's scene even when its tab is closed (a
  sheet not shown); it comes back as a plain QObject and is cast to `QGraphicsScene`.
- Two prints of the same sheet can differ in a few anti-aliased pixels of SVG text (272 of
  340000 at 50 dpi); a print with markers and the next one without were identical.
- FreeCAD's MDI view is a QMainWindow: the sheet bar is a toolbar at its bottom. FreeCAD
  makes the MDI tabs movable (`setTabsMovable(True)`), so a new sheet's tab can take the
  old sheet's place.
- A page removed by Undo while its tab shows leaves the tab open: the tab of a page that
  is gone is closed after the deletion (`drawing_sheets_ui.close_orphans`).

- TechDraw computes the hidden-line views in a thread in the GUI: a view's edges appear a
  moment after a recompute (scenarios wait for them).
- `DrawPage.addView` centres a new view on the sheet; SciForge sets the position after
  adding it. Projection groups (`DrawProjGroup`) left their items unparented and at (0, 0)
  and could crash; SciForge makes independent views and keeps them lined up itself.
- A section's `Direction` must equal its `SectionNormal`, and both must be set before the
  section is added to the page, or the cut fails ("failed to create section CS"); its
  `SectionOrigin` is the cut line's middle in the model.
- A view's label shows only when hovered: SciForge writes the label as the view's
  `Caption` (also printed in the PDF).
- FreeCAD's default hatch colour is green with no opacity (0x00FF0000): section hatching
  never showed. SciForge sets the hatch colours of every section; the light theme's grey
  sheet colour (`TechDraw/Colors/PageColor`, `FaceColor`) is set to white while SciForge
  is on (theme.py), also for the PDF.
- A broken view's break objects must be sketches (edges raised "TopoDS::Edge" errors).
- TechDraw formats dimensions in FreeCAD's current units only; an inch drawing in a mm
  session writes its dimension text itself (`Arbitrary`), and back.
- TechDraw shows a page's tab by setting the page's Visibility, which marks the document
  as changed; SciForge clears that mark when the design was saved.
- PySide ties items added to a scene to the Python wrapper of that scene: the preview
  outlines are added through one kept wrapper and marked, or they cannot be removed.
- FreeCAD's tree brings the tab of a selected object to the front ("Sync view"): the
  browser does not put drawings in FreeCAD's selection.
- When the widget with the keyboard is hidden (a timeline step rebuilt), Qt gives the
  keyboard to the next widget that takes Tab, and a drawing's tab that took it came to the
  front: the parts of a drawing's tab take the keyboard on click only.
- A view's cosmetic lines are drawn from its last recompute: a moved centre mark needs a
  recompute of its view.

## Tests

Part 2 scenarios (real clicks; any Report-view error fails them): `drawing2_tolerance`
(the Dimension dialog: fit H7 with tolerances, as limits, undo / redo, symmetric,
Cancel, deviation, a wrong pair refused, text before / after and a symbol button,
precision, basic, reference, a custom fit H8/f7, an unknown class refused, Esc, the
DXF), `drawing2_ordinate` (ordinates from a corner on both axes, lined up, Esc, undo /
redo, baseline, chain, arc length and its refusal, following the design),
`drawing2_symbols` (leader and its refusal, feature control frame with two datums, a
non-number refused, two datums with their default letters, surface texture on an edge,
editing the frame into a composite one, undo / redo, the view dragged: everything goes
with it, the DXF), `drawing2_sheets` (the sheet bar, +, a base view and a section on
sheet 2, switching, rename in place, move with undo / redo, PDF of all sheets (2 pages)
and of the current one, a DXF per sheet, delete with undo / redo, deleting the first
sheet, the last one refused), `drawing2_sections` (offset section through two holes,
undo / redo, half section, Esc, Slice and Distance depth switching off the deeper lines,
hidden edges, the view label, depth refused on a bent line, an aligned section, no seam
line across a hole cut in half), `drawing2_breakout` (Esc, a breakout with a clicked
boundary and a typed depth: the hole inside shows, the floor hatched; undo / redo; a
second one refused; its dialog by double-click: a depth through the part, Default, undo;
following the design; an isometric view inherits it; the DXF; Remove and undo; save and
reopen; deleting the view takes the copy), `drawing2_views` (automated centre marks and centre
lines, undo / redo, hidden edges per view, edge extension and a dimension to its point,
the view label with undo, a text box dragged open, following the design),
`drawing2_update` (fillet edited in the timeline, a hole moved and resized, Undo in the
design: tolerances, ordinates, leaders, frames, marks, extensions, sections follow),
`drawing2_reopen` (save, close, open: everything back, the dialog edits and undoes,
still following the design), `drawing_pdf_layers` (Export PDF by its dialog: the six
layers, metadata from the title block, osifont subset, the title block, a leader and the
parts list searchable, the dimension once, two links, no marker left, nothing in Undo;
rendered: every layer on looks exactly like TechDraw's print, each layer alone shows only
its things; an A3 and an A4 sheet in one file with one set of layers; a projection
group's items), `drawing_pdf_archival` (hidden edges as thin as the centre marks: the
mark still on its own layer; the file about as big as TechDraw's print; ′ ″ and a frame's
symbols searchable; PDF/A-1b: no layers, no marker, CIDSet, XMP in step; PDF/X-4: its
identity kept, no links). Unit tests: `test_drawing_pdf_core.py` (the PDF reader /
writer, the font subset and its licence check, layers from markers, text read back,
links, the invisible text, metadata, PDF/A and PDF/X, unused objects dropped, poppler
reading the result), `test_drawing_fits.py`,
`test_drawing_dims_core.py`, `test_drawing_annot_core.py` (with the PDF merge),
`test_drawing_core.py` (section types).

Part 1:

- Scenarios (real clicks, keys and menus on the sheet; any Report-view error fails them):
  `drawing_new.py` (empty design refused, the dialog, the drawing's tab and ribbon, the
  title block, Base View by click, undo / redo, Esc, back to the design, the browser's
  Drawings folder), `drawing_views.py` (projected views in first angle, undo, dragging the
  base view, its dialog and Cancel, an ASME Automatic drawing), `drawing_section.py`
  (section through the hole, label, undo, Esc, hatching off), `drawing_detail.py` (detail
  of a fillet, label, Esc, Break View, Del), `drawing_dimensions.py` (every kind from the
  one command, undo, forced Diameter, Esc, isometric refused), `drawing_annotations.py`
  (centre mark, refusals, undo, centre line, text, title block typed / Cancel, Del),
  `drawing_export.py` (PDF read back and rendered: white paper, hatching, the caption; DXF
  read back: the hole, the dimension, centre mark, hatching, texts; empty name refused; an
  inch ASME drawing), `drawing_update.py` (fillet edited in the timeline, Undo in the
  design, the hole moved: views, dimensions, centre mark follow), `drawing_reopen.py`
  (Ctrl+S on the sheet, close, open, everything back, undo / redo after reopening, still
  following the design), `drawing_assembly.py` (Contents Select, Full Assembly, parts list
  and automatic balloons, Balloon command, refusals, a renamed component, deleting a
  drawing from the browser and Undo).
- Unit tests `SciForgeTests/unit/test_drawing_core.py` (sheets and scales, the title block
  template, projected and section maths, dimension inference and formats, parts-list rows
  and table, balloon spots, hatch lines, the DXF writer).
