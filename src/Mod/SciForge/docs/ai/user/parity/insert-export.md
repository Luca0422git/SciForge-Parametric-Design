# Parity spec: Insert, import, export, make (outline 7.12)

Insert Mesh, Convert Mesh, Insert STEP, Insert SVG, Insert DXF, Canvas (Insert / Edit /
Calibrate), Export, 3D Print, Export Everything. The rest of the MESH tab (Repair, Remesh,
Reduce, Plane Cut...) is in `parity/mesh.md`. Copied behaviour only, never Fusion's assets,
wording or code. Status: **built and tested with real clicks (9 scenarios, 320 checks; Part 2 below: 5
more, 329 checks), not yet signed off by Luca**. Every choice marked **(assumed)** is a guess to confirm in real Fusion.

Code (all in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`):

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `insert.py` | no Qt: mesh units / flip / centre / ground maths, mesh bodies (`Mesh::Feature`), `ConvertMeshFeature` (a `PartDesign::FeaturePython` step), STEP into bodies, SVG / DXF curves into sketch geometry (fixed), canvases (`Image::ImagePlane`), calibrate maths |
| `insert_ui.py` | the dialogs: Insert Mesh (with the move manipulator), Convert Mesh, Insert SVG / DXF, Canvas / Edit Canvas, Calibrate; the Insert STEP command; browser hooks |
| `export.py` | no Qt: refinement presets, mesh writing (STL binary / ASCII, 3MF with body names, OBJ with groups), STEP writing, Export Everything's file plan and README |
| `export_ui.py` | the Export dialog, the 3D Print dialog (Send to Slicer), the Export Everything command |
| `slicer_core.py` | no Qt / FreeCAD: finding the slicers (Windows, Linux, macOS rules), the Send to list, the command line, units and file names (unit tests `test_slicer_core.py`) |
| `ribbon_config.py` | INSERT group, MESH tab (Insert Mesh, Convert Mesh), UTILITIES > MAKE (3D Print, Export, Export Everything), `FILE_MENU` (the quick-access Menu's File entries) |
| `browser_core.py` / `browser_ui.py` | mesh bodies in the Bodies folder, the Canvases folder, right-click entries (Convert Mesh, Edit Canvas, Calibrate) |
| `timeline_core.py` | the step kinds Insert Mesh, Convert Mesh, Insert STEP |

Tests: scenarios `insert_mesh.py` (Insert Mesh + Convert Mesh, 65 checks), `insert_step.py`
(22), `insert_svg.py` (38), `insert_dxf.py` (35), `insert_canvas.py` (48), `export_formats.py`
(53), `export_print.py` (41), `send_to_slicer.py` (106: fake slicers, no slicer found, Other..., Save a copy, Cancel, Preferences > 3D Print), `export_everything.py` (27), `insert_reopen.py` (save / reopen with
a mesh, a converted body and a canvas, 24); unit tests `test_insert_core.py`,
`test_export_core.py`; fixtures in `SciForgeTests/fixtures/` (made by `make_fixtures.py`).

## Part 2 (exchange-2, 2026-10-16): structure in and out, manipulators, linked designs

Built in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`: `exchange_core.py` (no FreeCAD: file kinds, how a
file's tree becomes components and bodies, how a design is written so it reads back the
same; unit tested in `test_exchange_core.py`), `step_import.py` (STEP / IGES with their
structure), `exchange.py` (STEP with components, IGES, DXF of a sketch or flat face, DWG
through a converter, meshes in a component's frame), `design_insert.py` (Insert into
Current Design as a linked component, Break Link), `exchange_ui.py` (File > Open, Insert
STEP's flow, Save As DXF, Save As Mesh, Break Link), the manipulator (`_PlaneHandles`) in
`insert_ui.py`, the Export dialog in `export_ui.py`, the Data Panel's Upload in
`versions_ui.py`. Scenarios `exchange2_step_open` (80 checks), `exchange2_step_insert`
(75), `exchange2_export` (89), `exchange2_manip` (43), `exchange2_link` (42); the earlier
`insert_step`, `insert_svg` and `versions_link` follow the new behaviour.

### Behaviour spec (sources: Autodesk = Autodesk help / support / blog; Forum = Autodesk
Community answer; Guess = no source found, to check in real Fusion)

| Fusion | Source | SciForge |
|---|---|---|
| A STEP file keeps its component structure and names ("STEP (.stp) files retain component structure and names") | Autodesk (handout "Fusion 360 Large Model Management"); Forum ("STEP files imported into Fusion create components"; a round trip Fusion > STEP > Fusion keeps the structure) | Same: every product of the file is a component named after it, nested as in the file |
| SAT files "will place all components into a flattened structure" | Autodesk (same handout) | SAT is refused: FreeCAD cannot read ACIS (the message says to save STEP in the other program) |
| IGES comes in as bodies (no assemblies in IGES) | Guess (IGES has no product structure) | The solids as bodies; a file of loose faces is sewn: closed shells become solids, open ones surface bodies |
| A part used several times comes in once, the others as copies ("Wheel:1", "Wheel:2") | Guess (Fusion's occurrence naming from Copy / Paste, parity/components.md) | Same: the second occurrence is a linked copy (instances.py), "Wheel:2"; the browser shows "Wheel:1" for the original |
| A part's solids are the component's bodies, numbered Body1, Body2 ... | Guess (Fusion numbers bodies per component) | Same; a single part opened on its own is a body of the design named after the part |
| File > Open of a STEP file (Fusion: Upload, then the translated design opens) | Autodesk (support "How to insert / open DXF files"; Data Panel Upload) | File > Open (Ctrl+O; the application menu) takes designs, STEP and IGES; a STEP / IGES file becomes a new, unsaved design named after the file (Ctrl+S then asks where to keep it) |
| Upload in the Data Panel | Autodesk (Data Panel pages) | The Data Panel's **Upload** copies a STEP / IGES file into the folder shown; double-click opens it as a design; right-click > Insert into Current Design |
| Insert into Current Design: "inserted as an external component and the Initial Position dialog displays"; "position the component by dragging manipulators in the canvas or by entering Distance and Angle values"; "An Insert feature displays in the Timeline" | Autodesk (help "Insert designs", ASM-INSERT-FUSION-DESIGN) | Insert STEP: the whole file is one component named after the file, in the active component, one undo step; then the Move dialog opens on it (arrows and Distance / Angle fields); Esc leaves it where it came in (**Guess**: Esc in Fusion's Initial Position) |
| The inserted design is "associatively linked to the source design"; when the source changes, it is out of date and can be brought up to date | Autodesk (help "Insert designs created in other CAD applications": Out-Of-Date icon) | Insert Component (Insert Design, the Data Panel's Insert into Current Design) of a SciForge design: one component named after it, linked to its file by a relative path; its bodies are copies of the other design's bodies; when the other design was saved again, the copies are brought up to date as the design opens (no out-of-date icon: they follow at once) |
| Right-click > Break Link: "Your component now becomes a stand-alone part, and you're free to edit its features within your current file" | Autodesk (blog "Insert Into Current Design ... Break Link") | Same: the other design's bodies are copied in with every feature (their steps join the timeline), one undo step; refused with the reason when the other design is not found |
| File > Export types: Fusion archive, Inventor, DWG, DXF, FBX, IGES, OBJ, SAT, SketchUp, SMT, STEP, STL (newer help: 3MF, USDZ) | Autodesk (support "How to export a CAD design from Fusion"; help "Export designs") | Type: STEP, IGES, STL (Binary), STL (ASCII), 3MF, OBJ, DXF, DWG; Export: Whole design, Selected bodies or **A component** (a list of the components) |
| STEP export keeps the structure (round trip) | Forum (the round-trip test above) | Each component is a product (a component with bodies only is a part named after it; with components in it, an assembly holding them and a part of its name for its bodies); a copy of a component is a second occurrence of the same product; colours kept. Opened again: the same components, copies, bodies, places and colours (`exchange2_export` P1) |
| Save As Mesh of a component: "the selected component defines the coordinate system"; "only visible bodies are exported"; Structure One File / One Body Per File | Forum (Autodesk employee); Autodesk (help "Save bodies in a component as 3MF, OBJ, or STL files") | Export > A component (or right-click a component or body > **Save As Mesh**, which opens the Export dialog on it with 3MF): the shown bodies of the component and its components, in the component's own coordinates; One File / One File Per Body as before |
| Right-click a sketch > Save As DXF: "this method will include only the geometry in that individual sketch"; "If your design doesn't include a sketch, the Save As DXF option is disabled" | Autodesk (support "How to export a Fusion design to a DWG or DXF file"); SendCutSend guide | Same entry in the browser's sketch menu: the sketch's curves in the sketch's own X / Y (whatever plane it is on), mm ($INSUNITS 4); construction lines are left out (**Guess**) |
| DXF of a flat face | Guess (Fusion: project the face into a sketch, then Save As DXF) | Export, Type DXF, with a flat face picked (or Use Selection): its edges in the face's own frame, the origin at its middle |
| DWG of a design ("DWG and DXF export a wireframe") | Autodesk (export list); the content is not documented | DWG is written only through a free converter (LibreDWG's dxf2dwg, the ODA File Converter or QCAD, found the way FreeCAD finds them); without one, Export refuses and names them. This machine has none, so the DWG path is untested |
| Insert SVG: "the manipulator handles allow you to move, rotate, and scale the SVG image on the active sketch plane"; "the image geometry is centered on the sketch origin"; "Z Angle: Rotates the image geometry around the origin point. Positive values are clockwise" | Autodesk (support "How to insert and engrave an SVG file"; help "Add an SVG image", SLD-INS-SVG, read through search excerpts) | Same: the SVG is centred on the sketch origin; positive Z Angle turns it clockwise; the manipulator sits at its middle: two arrows (X / Y Distance), a curved handle (Z Angle), an arrow beyond its right edge (Scale), each with a value box; Enter in a value box takes the value and finishes (OK), as Enter does everywhere in Fusion |
| The SVG manipulator follows the sketch plane (a bug made it follow the world axes in a child component) | Forum (FUS-97316, Autodesk QA) | The arrows follow the plane's X and Y |
| Insert DXF: "the DXF origin is placed at the sketch origin" | Autodesk (help "Insert a DXF file") | Same; its manipulator sits at the DXF's origin (where it turns and scales about); its Z Angle turns counter-clockwise (**Guess**: no source for DXF) |
| Canvas: the manipulator "stays anchored to the image's center"; no way to move the pivot | Forum (Autodesk support answer, "Dynamic Manipulator") | Same handles at the picture's middle (Z Angle counter-clockwise, **Guess**); Edit Canvas has them too; the scale handle scales X and Y together; Calibrate's scale is kept (the handles start from it) |
| The manipulator keeps its size on the screen when zooming | Guess (every Fusion manipulator does) | The handles are made again when the view is zoomed, panned or turned |
| McMaster-Carr insert | Autodesk (Insert > Insert McMaster-Carr Component) | Not built: it needs McMaster's online catalogue inside the program; a STEP downloaded from mcmaster.com goes in with Insert STEP. Standard screws, nuts, washers, heat-set inserts and magnets come from SciForge's own offline library: INSERT > Hardware... (parity/hardware.md) |

### Known gaps of Part 2 (also listed in Known gaps below)

- Body names inside components do not survive a STEP round trip (FreeCAD's STEP writer has
  no names for the solids of a product): they come back as Body1, Body2 (Fusion keeps them).
  A component named like its only sub-component folds into one level when read back.
- An inserted design's own components come in flat (its bodies in one component), like a
  copy of a component (parity/components.md); a linked copy can be changed in this design
  (Fusion locks it until Break Link).
- No out-of-date icon and no Get Latest: the copies follow the other design's saved file
  when this design opens.
- Insert STEP is a one-off import (not linked to the STEP file).
- DWG untested (no converter in the sandbox); the DWG path converts the DXF SciForge writes.
- SAT / SMT / F3D / FBX / USD / SketchUp / Inventor: not read or written (FreeCAD has no
  readers or writers for them; ACIS needs a commercial kernel).
- A decal keeps its own manipulator (decal_ui.py: arrows, turn and scale, value boxes on the
  arrows and the turn); its scale arrow has no value box.

## Part 3 (export-report, 2026-10-21): what an export leaves out, what an import skipped

Idea 2 of `docs/sciforge/dev/cadcraft-lessons.md`, approved by Luca: never drop data
silently. After every export (File > Export, Save As DXF, 3D Print, Export Everything, a
drawing's Export PDF / DXF) a short card in the bottom right corner of the 3D view says what
the file does not keep, counted from this design ("Not kept in this file: the timeline (4
steps); 2 sketches; the colours of 1 body ..."); after Insert Mesh, Insert SVG / DXF and
Open / Insert STEP it says what did not come in. No card when nothing is lost; no pop-up;
the same line goes to the Report view. Fusion has no such message (this goes beyond it, as
CADCraft does); the wording is SciForge's own.

Built in `src/Mod/SciForge/sciforge/`: `export_report_core.py` (no FreeCAD: the rules per
format and the sentences, unit tested in `test_export_report_core.py`), `export_report.py`
(the counts from the real design, following each export path exactly; `losses(doc, objects,
fmt)` is the function the AI tools can call), `export_report_ui.py` (the card). Golden
models `export_report_design`, `export_report_sketch_dxf`, `export_report_imports` (each
claim proven by writing the file and reading it back, `golden/export_checks.py`); scenarios
`export_report`, `import_report`, and `drawing_export` checks the drawing DXF's message.

| File | What it does not keep (checked in FreeCAD 1.1.4) |
|---|---|
| Every 3D file | the timeline, sketches, construction planes / axes / points, parameters (values built in), joints, physical materials, cosmetic threads, decals and canvases; hidden bodies and surface bodies are not exported |
| STEP | written body by body (Export > Selected bodies, Export Everything, the AI's STEP export with the window open) it is flat: no components; File > Export of the whole design or a component keeps components, copies and colours (with the window open; FreeCAD's headless writer has none); see-through looks come out opaque; bodies in a component come back Body1, Body2 ... (a single body at the design's root keeps its name); mesh bodies cannot go in |
| IGES | no components, no colours; the body names are in the file (other programs read them) but SciForge's own reader brings them back as Body1, Body2 ...; mesh bodies cannot go in |
| STL | one mesh (several bodies merged: no names, no parts), no colours, no unit; curved faces become triangles |
| 3MF | names and unit kept; no colours, no components; curved faces become triangles |
| OBJ | names kept (groups); no colours (no material file), no unit, no components |
| DXF / DWG of a sketch | dimensions, constraints, construction curves, points, projected curves that are only references (Project and Auto project make "defining" curves, which are written); flat in the sketch's own X and Y |
| Drawing DXF | dimensions and symbols as plain lines and text, curves that are not circles / arcs as short lines, hatching as separate lines, no named font; hidden views; the other sheets with Current Sheet |
| Drawing PDF | hidden views; the other sheets with Current Sheet |

Imports: Insert Mesh (open edges, edges shared by more than two triangles, flipped
triangles, a 3MF's several objects in one body, its colours, its own unit when it differs
from Unit Type), Insert DXF (entities FreeCAD's importer cannot read, from its own
statistics; texts / dimensions and points, which are not curves), Insert SVG (texts,
pictures), Open / Insert STEP and IGES (loose faces of a part that also has solids, loose
curves and points, loose faces sewn into surface bodies, shapes with errors: checked on the
first 300 faces of a file only, the check is slow on big parts).

  their Windows installers' defaults (**from memory; Guess** where a version changes them).
- Fusion inserts STEP files through its Data Panel (upload, then Insert into Current Design,
  which opens a Move dialog) or opens them as a design: SciForge has no cloud panel, so
  **Insert STEP** picks the file at once (support article "How to insert a mesh body" for the
  Insert menu's shape; the components doc for where the bodies go, once components exist).

## What gets built

| Tool | Built as |
|---|---|
| Insert Mesh | a `Mesh::Feature` at document level (SciForgeType `InsertMesh`), its triangles in design units, Z up; Placement = the dialog's position and angles; `SourceFile`, `UnitType`, `FlipUp`, `UnitScale` remembered so the step can be edited without the file |
| Convert Mesh | a new body whose first step is SciForge's `ConvertMesh` feature (`Source` = the mesh body, `Method`, `Parametric`, `Tolerance`); Parametric rebuilds from the mesh when it moves or changes, Base Feature keeps the solid it made |
| Insert STEP | the file as one component (`App::Part`) named after it, its products as nested components, each solid a `PartDesign::Body` (FreeCAD's `BaseFeature` step, marked `InsertSTEP`, its base `Part::Feature` inside the component), a repeated part as an instance (`instances.py`), its colours as a SciForge Appearance (per face when the part has several); read with FreeCAD's STEP reader in a hidden throw-away document (Part 2) |
| Insert SVG / DXF | sketch geometry (lines, circles, arcs, ellipses, splines) added to a sketch with a `Block` constraint each (fixed, green), made from FreeCAD's `importSVG` / `importDXF` run in a throw-away hidden document; the dialog's X / Y / angle / scale / flips are applied to the geometry itself (never OpenCASCADE's shape transform, which turns everything into B-splines) |
| Canvas | an `Image::ImagePlane` (SciForgeType `Canvas`, kept out of the timeline) with the picture inside the design file (FreeCAD's `ImageFile` keeps a copy), `PlaneFrame` = the plane it sits on, `BaseWidth` / `BaseHeight`, `ScaleX` / `ScaleY`, `XDistance`, `YDistance`, `ZAngle`, `FlipHorizontal`, `FlipVertical`, `CanvasOpacity`, `DisplayThrough`; opacity = the view's Transparency, Display Through = the image drawn as a Coin annotation (after everything else, no depth test), Selectable = the view's Selectable |
| Export (meshes) | FreeCAD's mesher with Surface Deviation (linear deflection, mm) and Normal Deviation (angular deflection); STL = one mesh (the union), 3MF and OBJ = one object per body with its name (the 3MF object names and unit are written by SciForge, FreeCAD leaves them out) |
| Export (STEP / IGES) | a hidden throw-away document mirroring the components (Part 2), written by FreeCAD's `ImportGui.export` (names and colours); IGES with solids (OpenCASCADE's brep mode 1) |
| Export (DXF / DWG) | the sketch's or face's edges in its own 2D frame, written by FreeCAD's `importDXF`; DWG converted by FreeCAD's `importDWG.convertToDwg` when a converter is installed |
| Export Everything | `<design folder>/<name>-export/` with `<name>.step`, `.stl`, `.3mf`, `.obj` (Medium refinement), `.png` (the 3D view, 1600 x 1200) and `README.txt` saying what each file is |

## What the user does (and what SciForge does)

### Insert Mesh (INSERT > Insert Mesh; MESH tab > Insert Mesh)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Pick an STL / OBJ / 3MF file | same (the system file dialog; the folder is remembered) |
| The mesh body appears at once in the Bodies folder, "Insert Mesh" in the timeline | same: the Bodies folder lists it with a mesh icon, named after the file; the timeline step is "Insert Mesh N" (its tooltip) shown with the file's name |
| Unit Type: Centimeter, Millimeter, Meter, Inch, Foot; Fusion starts at Centimeter (forum: STLs came in ten times too big until Millimeter was chosen) | same choices, same order; **SciForge starts at the design's unit** (Millimeter for a mm design), a deliberate difference: slicer STLs are in mm, and the ten-times-too-big insert is a known Fusion annoyance (Luca to confirm he wants it this way); a change re-scales the triangles |
| Flip Up Direction: Y and Z swapped (a Y-up file turned Z-up) | same: 90 degrees about X, as a check box **(assumed: Fusion's is a button)** |
| Center: the box's middle to the origin; Move to Ground: the lowest point on Z = 0 | same |
| X / Y / Z Distance and Angle fields, manipulator arrows and turn handles, Reset | same: the Move manipulator (three arrows, three turn handles, drawn on top), the fields follow a drag and a drag follows the fields; turns are about the mesh's middle **(assumed)** |
| OK keeps the mesh body; Cancel removes it; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y | same, one undo step |
| Edit Feature on the timeline step | timeline double-click opens the dialog again (unit, flip, position); Cancel puts everything back |
| the number of triangles | shown in the dialog with the size in mm and a note when the mesh is not watertight |

### Convert Mesh (MESH tab > Convert Mesh; right-click a mesh body in the browser)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Body: a mesh body (click it) | same; the dialog waits with its box blue; a mesh body picked before the command, or the browser's right-click entry, fills it |
| Operation: Parametric / Base Feature | same (Parametric follows the mesh body: move the mesh, the solid follows, also after save and reopen) |
| Method: Faceted / Prismatic / Organic | Faceted (one flat face per triangle) and Prismatic (flat faces merged: a box becomes 6 faces, a cylinder's sides stay faceted: FreeCAD fits no curved surfaces); Organic not offered (Fusion: extension only) |
| Live preview; the converted body in the Bodies folder, "Convert Mesh" in the timeline | same; the new body is named "<mesh> (solid)" and becomes the active body |
| A warning for big meshes | above 10 000 triangles the dialog says the conversion can take a while **(the limit is Fusion's; what it says is SciForge's)** |
| Not watertight: cannot convert | the dialog says so and points at MESH > Repair; OK waits |
| The mesh body afterwards | hidden (its eye off) **(assumed)**; Ctrl+Z shows it again |

### Insert STEP (INSERT > Insert STEP; File menu; Data Panel > Insert into Current Design)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Upload the STEP to the Data Panel, then Insert into Current Design (the Initial Position dialog opens) | pick the file (STEP or IGES; or the Data Panel's uploaded file); the file comes in as one component named after it, in the active component; the Move dialog opens on it (Part 2) |
| The STEP's component structure, the parts' names, colours | same: nested components named after the products, Body1 ... in each, per-face colours kept; a part used twice comes in once plus a linked copy ("Wheel:2"); the timeline shows the components and "Insert STEP N" per body |
| A second insert of the same file | **(beta 3, vex)** the same file (same path, size and date) again: another occurrence of the first insert, linked ("two_parts:2"; parity/vex-assembly.md, section 3); a changed file or a copy elsewhere: "two_parts (2)" with its own components |
| Several files at once | **(SciForge, beta 3 vex)** Insert STEP picks several files: one component per file, side by side, one undo step, then the Move dialog on all of them (parity/vex-assembly.md) |
| Ctrl+Z | the Move first, then the whole insert; Ctrl+Y brings them back with their colours |
| File > Open of a STEP / IGES file | a new design of the file (Part 2) |

### Insert SVG / Insert DXF (INSERT menu; File menu)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Pick the file, then a planar face or plane (an active sketch is used) | same: the origin squares light up like Create Sketch, flat faces can be clicked; a sketch that is open gets the curves (the sketch is closed while the dialog runs and opened again on OK or Cancel) |
| The curves appear in a sketch; an SVG "centered on the sketch origin", a DXF's origin at the sketch origin | same (Part 2); Y of an SVG pointing down (as FreeCAD reads SVG and as Fusion's Y Distance says) |
| X Distance, Y Distance, Z Angle (SVG: positive clockwise), Scale Plane XY, Horizontal Flip, Vertical Flip, manipulators | the fields (live) and the manipulator on the plane: two arrows, a curved handle, a scale arrow, value boxes (Part 2) |
| DXF: Units (the file's, or a unit the file's numbers count in), Insert Mode Single Sketch / One Sketch per Layer, DXF Layers ticked | same; "As in the file" takes FreeCAD's reading of $INSUNITS; per-layer sketches are named "<file> <layer>" |
| The geometry is fixed after OK | same: a Block constraint on every curve (green = fixed in SciForge's sketches) |
| OK: the sketch is the active sketch | the sketch opens for editing (Finish Sketch, or E to extrude it) |
| Pixel SVGs come in small (96 px per inch) | same as FreeCAD reads them; Scale fixes it (Fusion users type 0.3528 or 96 in the same case) |
| FreeCAD's own DXF import dialog | kept off during the import (SciForge's dialog holds the choices); the user's setting is put back |

### Canvas (INSERT > Canvas; browser > Canvases)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Pick the image (PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF), then a face or plane | same |
| The image is sized "to the target plane" (approximate), centred on the face / plane origin | the longer side 1.3 x the design's longest dimension (the origin squares' size), 100 mm in an empty design, centred on the face's centre (a plane: its origin); the picture keeps its proportions |
| Canvas Opacity (50 %), Display Through (on), Selectable, Horizontal / Vertical Flip, X / Y Distance, Z Angle, Scale X / Y / Plane XY | same fields, same defaults; Display Through draws the image over everything in front of it; a flip turns the picture over (the image plane shows both sides) |
| Canvases folder in the browser, eye, rename, delete; not in the timeline | same **(not in the timeline: assumed)** |
| Right-click > Edit Canvas | same (also a double-click on the row); Cancel puts the values back |
| The manipulator at the picture's middle (move, turn, scale) | same in Canvas and Edit Canvas, with value boxes (Part 2) |
| Right-click > Calibrate: two points, the distance, Enter | same: the dialog says which point to click, draws the two points and the line, shows the picked distance in the field; type the real distance, Enter (or OK): the canvas scales about its centre **(about which point Fusion scales: assumed)**; the clicks land on screen pixels, so the result is within about 0.1 mm |
| Save, reopen: the canvas is there | same, the picture is inside the design file (FreeCAD keeps a copy); Display Through and opacity are put back when a design opens |

### Export (UTILITIES > MAKE > Export; File menu > Export)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| File > Export: Name, Type, Location, Export | the Export dialog: Export (Whole design / Selected bodies with a ticked list / A component), Type (STEP, IGES, STL Binary, STL ASCII, 3MF, OBJ, DXF, DWG), Sketch or face (DXF / DWG, with Use Selection), Name, Location (…), "Open the folder afterwards", Export (Part 2) |
| Mesh types from Save As Mesh: Unit Type, Structure One File / One File Per Body, Refinement Low / Medium / High / Custom, Surface Deviation, Normal Deviation, Number of Triangles | same rows (shown for mesh types; greyed for STEP); the count follows the refinement |
| Formats SciForge does not write | SAT, SMT, F3D, FBX, USD, SketchUp, Inventor (FreeCAD has no writers for them); DWG only through a free converter (Part 2) |
| A body with no solid | left out of the list; "Whole design" exports the shown bodies **(hidden bodies left out: assumed)**; mesh bodies are listed and written with their own triangles (STEP refuses them: `parity/mesh.md`) |

### 3D Print (UTILITIES > MAKE > 3D Print; File menu)

| Fusion | SciForge |
|---|---|
| Selection: bodies | the bodies list, ticked from the selection (else all shown bodies) |
| Preparation Type Export; Format 3MF / STL (Binary) / STL (ASCII) / OBJ | the formats (Manufacturing left out: no CAM) |
| Refinement Low / Medium / High / Custom with Surface Deviation, Normal Deviation (Maximum Edge Length, Aspect Ratio), Preview Mesh, Number of Triangles | Low = 0.127 mm / 30 deg, Medium = 0.0508 mm / 15 deg, High = 0.0254 mm / 10 deg **(the numbers Fusion shows for a mm design, from memory: thousandths of an inch; unconfirmed)**, Custom takes the two fields; Number of Triangles; no Maximum Edge Length / Aspect Ratio (FreeCAD's mesher has no such settings) and no Preview Mesh overlay (gaps) |
| Preparation Type Print Utility: Application = a drop-down of the 3D print utilities Fusion found on the computer, or Custom (then point it at the program); older versions: a "Send to 3D Print Utility" check box with the same list (sources below) | **Send to** drop-down (Send to Slicer, 2026-10-18): the slicers SciForge finds (PrusaSlicer, Bambu Studio, OrcaSlicer, UltiMaker Cura), then "Other... (pick the program)" (Fusion's Custom: choosing it opens the program picker; Program row with "…") and "Save file only" (Fusion's Export). One drop-down instead of Preparation Type + Application: same choices, parity level B |
| How Fusion finds the utilities (not documented) | **(SciForge's own rules)** Windows: Program Files, Program Files (x86), `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs` (`Prusa3D\PrusaSlicer\prusa-slicer.exe`, `Bambu Studio\bambu-studio.exe`, `OrcaSlicer\orca-slicer.exe`, the newest `UltiMaker Cura <version>\UltiMaker-Cura.exe`); Linux: the PATH, Flatpak (`/var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin`, `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin`), AppImages in `~/Applications`, `~/Downloads`, `~/bin`; macOS: `/Applications/*.app`. No registry, nothing started. `slicer_core.py` |
| Nothing found | **(SciForge's own)** the dialog says plainly that no slicer was found and offers Other... and Save file only (it starts at Save file only); OK on Other... without a program says so and writes nothing |
| OK with a utility: the file goes to the slicer (forum users: Fusion hands it an STL / 3MF; a slicer already running sometimes got an empty plate, Autodesk ticket FUS-171507) | OK writes the file to SciForge's temporary print folder (files older than 7 days cleaned up) and starts the slicer with the file's path as its argument (detached: SciForge carries on). A Windows shortcut (.lnk) or batch file is started the way a double click does (`cmd /c start`), a macOS .app with `open -a` |
| The file the slicer gets | one object per body named after the body, placed as in the design; **always millimetres when sending** (Unit Type greyed at Millimeter: slicers work in mm and an STL has no unit; 3MF says `unit="millimeter"`). Named after the body for one body, after the design for several |
| (Fusion has no such option: Guess) | **Also save a copy next to the design** (SciForge's own, Luca's request): the same file beside the design file (or the last export folder for an unsaved design); never overwrites (`name-2.3mf`...), since slicers save their projects as .3mf too |
| Fusion remembers the utility (forum: "Send to 3D Print Utility always reverts to checked"; after 2.0.20256 the Preparation Type was not remembered for some users) | Send to, the Other program, Format and Save a copy are remembered on OK (Cancel keeps the old ones) and shown on **Preferences > 3D Print** (SciForge's own page: Send to, Program (Other), Format, Also save a copy; it also lists the slicers found) |
| Save file only (Export) | OK asks where to save (the Unit Type chosen is used) and opens the folder |

### Export Everything (UTILITIES > MAKE; File menu)

Luca's ownership guarantee (outline 5.6): one command writes the whole design to open formats.
Beside a saved design `Bracket.FCStd` it makes `Bracket-export/` with `Bracket.step`,
`Bracket.stl`, `Bracket.3mf`, `Bracket.obj`, `Bracket.png` and `README.txt`, then opens the
folder. A design never saved asks for a folder first. An empty design says there is nothing to
export. Fusion has no such command (its nearest is File > Export, one format at a time).

## Known gaps (never faked: listed here)

| Fusion behaviour | Why not (yet) |
|---|---|
| Insert McMaster-Carr | needs McMaster's online catalogue in the program (SciForge is offline): a downloaded STEP goes in with Insert STEP; standard hardware: INSERT > Hardware... (parity/hardware.md). Derive, Decal, Insert Component: their own docs (parity/misc.md, Part 2) |
| STEP body names inside components after a round trip; an inserted design's own components; a linked copy locked against edits; the out-of-date icon | Part 2, Known gaps |
| Convert Mesh "Organic", surface fitting of round faces (Prismatic keeps them faceted) | FreeCAD has no mesh-to-surface fitting |
| Export: SAT, SMT, F3D, FBX, USD; DWG without a converter | no FreeCAD writers; DWG needs LibreDWG / ODA / QCAD installed (untested here) |
| 3D Print: Maximum Edge Length, Aspect Ratio, Preview Mesh overlay, Manufacturing preparation | FreeCAD's mesher has no edge length / aspect settings; no CAM |
| 3D Print: utilities Fusion lists that SciForge does not look for (PreForm, Meshmixer, Print Studio...) and slicers beyond the four (Creality Print, Elegoo, SuperSlicer...) | pick them with Other...; more can be added to `slicer_core.SLICERS` (one entry each) |
| A slicer that is already open getting the file | up to the slicer (PrusaSlicer / OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio open a second window or hand the file to the open one, depending on their own "single instance" setting); untested with the real programs, only with stand-ins |
| The exact refinement numbers of Low / Medium / High | from memory of Fusion's dialog, to confirm |
| An inserted mesh in the timeline rolls back with the marker | mesh bodies sit outside the PartDesign bodies, so the history marker never hides them |
| Canvas: "Render as" options | not built (rendering is out of scope) |
| FreeCAD's SVG importer skips text and gradients; a `<circle>` with stroke attributes came in at twice its position in one FreeCAD build | FreeCAD's importer; the fixture avoids stroke attributes, real files may need a path-based circle |
